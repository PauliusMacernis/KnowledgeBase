- **What is the difference between `javac` and `java` commands?**  
`javac` command is the command to start the java coompiler (c at the end of the javac). After the compiler creates the byte code you can call the `java` command to start the compiled programm and give it the name of your compiled programm. So `java` command (without a c) starts a Java application. It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified class, and calling that class's main method.

- **What is the difference between the Java runtime environment (JRE) and Java virtual machine (JVM)?**  
Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc. Actually JVM runs the program, and it uses the class libraries, and other supporting files provided in JRE.
