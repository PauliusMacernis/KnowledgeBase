- **What is the difference between `javac` and `java` commands?**  
`javac` command is the command to start the java coompiler (c at the end of the javac). After the compiler creates the byte code you can call the `java` command to start the compiled programm and give it the name of your compiled programm. So `java` command (without a c) starts a Java application. It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified class, and calling that class's main method.
