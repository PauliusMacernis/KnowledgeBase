# Questions
There are some questions that need to be answered well by senior-master-level ninjas.  
Whoever you are, you may check your own level of ninjaness on any of many topics too. [Pick any to read](https://github.com/sugalvojau/Knowledge-base)!

- This repository contains question-answer sets, kind of tests.
- Do not like reading?  
**Go and play it**: http://mokytis.veikt.com/
- All sets are in a standard Markdown format, even kids may understand it:  
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.
- All sets are opensource, it is free to use, copy-paste, update, **extend (aha!)**, .. , for everyone, including ninjas.

I was always wondering if there is a simple way to create tests on the fly, any topic.  
This project is my 5 cents into the field.

What do I use it for?  
- Reading a book?
- Watching a webinar?
- Exploring a documentation or a manual?
- Listening to a podcast?
- Preparing for a test in a school, college, university?
- Preparing for a certification?  

It is always worth to take some notes in a question-answer format! That's what I try to do from time to time :)

Any mistakes?
I know, it may happen. Simply fix the bug and push the change. ‚ù§
