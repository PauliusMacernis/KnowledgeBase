- What is the difference between a library and a driver?
<a href="#" title="
Technically, they're the same thing: bodies of subroutines whose names are exported to a linker (static or runtime). By convention, a 'library' is used directly by an application, whose programmer will require documentation and header files. A 'driver', by contrast, is defined by a binary API and is used in some kind of framework, hence printer driver and video driver.
