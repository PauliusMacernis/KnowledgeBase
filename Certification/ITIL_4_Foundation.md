- **What are the industrial revolutions, when it has happened, what each of it has to do with ITIL?**  
  1st industrial revolution. Around 18-19 centuries. Humanity moved from agrarian-based farmer societies into urbanized industrial area. Mechanization (iron, textile), steam (e.g. steam engines) and water power. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  2nd industrial revolution. Around WWI (1st WWorld War) we moved to mass production and electricity. For example, steal, oil, electricity, electric-powered equipment, cars with internal combustion engines, light bulb light replace candle light, communication across long distance became possible through the use of a telephone, etc. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  3rd industrial revolution (digital revolution). Around 1980s-1990s. Electronic and IT systems, automation. ITIL was starting in this period of time. ITIL ment Information Technology Infrastructure Library back then. (the name became not valid after ITILv4 release)  
  4th industrial revolution. Around early 21st century. It is happening now. Cyber physical systems in where we loose boundaries between physical and digital. For example: robotics, nano technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, autonomous cars,etc. ITIL4 is not an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, it is ITIL (just a brand name) for 4th industrial revolution. ITIL is for the entire service now.   
  
  
- **What is Service Organization?**    
  !!!THIS IS MY OWN ANSWER TAKEN FROM THE CONTEXT OF ITILv4 STUDY MATERIAL. THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. HOWEVER, I DO THINK IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR THE ITILv4 FOUNDATION CASE.!!!    
  It is an organization that is involved in services by any means.  
  Actually, Service management goes beyond services these days, we may probably call services "something".  
  
  
- **What is Service Management?**    
  A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling **value** to customers in the form of **services**.    
  ITIL 4 provides organizations with a comprehensive framework for IT service management.   
  
  
- **What is Governance?**  
  The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.  
  Each organization has a different process, for example to direct and control vacation requests of employees. The way an organization runs things is known as governance.    
  
  
 <!-- Service Management -->
  
  
- **What Organizational capability refers to in ITIL4?**  
  Organizational capability refers to having both the **capacity** and the **ability** to perform the functions required.  
  
  
- **What should organization do in order to perform the functions required?**    
  **Organize** people to best support the activities, practices, and processes. (None of these activities, practices, and processes could be done in isolation. Instead, organization should go through service management process.)    
  
  
- **What is Value?**  
  The **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.   
  
  
- **Who determines the perceived value?**  
  The recipient determines the perceived value.   
  Value is based on **recipient's** perception.  
  The example of orange:   
  1st case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten, peel (0% value) is thrown away. Total value - 100%   
  2nd case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (0% value) is thrown away, peel (100% value) is used for the cake. Total value - 100%  
  3rd case: Orange got by two people, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten by one person, peel (100% value) is used for the cake by another person. Total value - 200%    
  
  
- **Who creates the value?**   
  Value is **co-created** by the service provider and the consumer. Example certification course online - service provider should input the course, service consumer should take the course and successfully pass the exam after.  
  Value is **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.  
  Value perceived is determined by the recipient.    
  
  
- **What is Organization?**    
  A person or a group of people that has its own functions, responsibilities, and relationships to achieve its objectives.  
  Organizations vary in size, complexity, and in their legal structure.  
  
  
- **What are two basic roles an ORGANIZATION can fulfill?**   
  1. Service Provider (supplier)  
  2. Consumer  
  Service Provider (supplier) AND Consumer may be simultaneous (e.g. providing services, having partners to manage, buying materials from somewhere, etc.).  
  
  
- **What are three basic roles PEOPLE can fulfill?**   
  User  
  Customer  
  Sponsor  
  All these basic roles people in organization may fulfill (user, customer, sponsor) may by fulfilled by the same person (e.g. buying a new car to myself) or several people (e.g. buying the new car for own child/user when mom/customer is picking the car and dad/sponsor is giving money for it).  
  
  
- **May a disconnect between requirements, budget, and usability occur?**  
  Yes. A disconnect between requirements (customer), budget (sponsor), and usability (user) may occur. This kind of disconnection may cause problems because sponsor who funds the requirements and customer who creates these requirements often have arguments over what those requirement should be.      
  
  
- **What is Service Provider?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a service relationship to provide services to consumers.  
  
  
- **What is Consumer?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a relationship that uses (or consumes) those services.   
  
  
- **By which means organizations are bound together?**  
  Organizations are bound together by common objectives, relationships, and authorities.  
  People are **organized** around common goals *within* a larger business organization to achieve common objectives in a coordinated method.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: User?**  
  A person who uses services.  
  User ~ usability.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: Customer?**  
  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.   
  Customer ~ requirements.   
  
  
- **What is a role of: Sponsor?**    
  A person who authorizes the budget for service consumption.   
  Sponsor ~ budget (also:, efficiency, cost savings).  
  
  
- **What is our responsibility as a Service provider in regards of three basic user roles within the company?**    
  It is our responsibility to recognize these three generic roles on a consumer side, and work with them appropriately.    
  
  
- **What is Service?**  
  **Means of enabling value co-creation** by **facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve**, **without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks**.  
  Services may be based on products.  
  
  
- **What is the whole reason Consumer (customer) hires Service provider?**    
  Costs and risks passed to Service provider refers to the whole reason why a consumer (a customer) hires a service provider in the first place.  
  
  
- **Can service provider achieve outcomes for a consumer?**  
  A service provider **cannot** achieve outcomes for a consumer. Consumer has to achieve outcomes by their self.  
  Service provider is only able to facilitate the achievement of those customer outcomes.  
  For example, service provider may ensure the server is up and able to run the e-shop but if consumer do not provide necessary input steps then achieving desired outputs and eventually the outcomes are not possible.  
  
  
- **May services be based on products?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **What is Product?**  
  Configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for its customers.    
  Resources can be owned or managed by organization. Resources could be leased, or rented, could even be people working in organization, etc.    
  We may also think about it as a collection of services put together that provides more value together than they could individually.   
  A **product** is how an organization configures resources into an offer. For example, AWS has many service offerings but if you add these products into a set then it may become a product, e.g. Amazon lightsail.    
  A product **combines** and simplifies the various services.    
  
  
- **What is Service Offering**  
  A description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  
  
- **What can include Service offerings?**  
  Service offering can include:    
  Goods  
  Access to resources    
  Service actions   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Service, Product and Service offering?**    
  !!! THIS IS NOT PROVEN ANSWER!!!   
  Terms:   
  Service - a description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  Product - "a configuration of an organization’s resources designed to offer value for a consumer."    
  Service offering - "a description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources, and service actions."    
  *My answer to that:*   
  Service - the smallest entity in the set of Service, Product, Service offering.    
  Product - a set of Services.   
  Service offering - a description of Service or Product.  
  
  
- **What are Goods?**  
  Things that are transferred from the Service provider to the Consumer, and then the Consumer is responsible for their future use.  
  For example: a phone from a service provider.   
  
  
- **What is Access to Resources?**  
  Access to resources are granted or licensed to a consumer under agreed terms and conditions.    
  For example: a paid membership on the website.  
  
  
- **What is Service action?**  
  Actions performed to address a consumer's needs.  
  For example: an additional support on using a web platform.  
  
    
- **What is Service Relationship?**  
  A cooperation between a Service provider and Service consumer including service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.    
  
  
- **What is Service provision?**  
  The activities performed by an organization to provide the services.    
  For example: managing service provider resources, configure them to deliver the services, providing access to the resources to the users, and fulfilling the agreed upon servuce actions, conducting service level management, performing continual improvement to the services, supplying good to the consumers, etc.    
  
    
- **Give at least one example of Account provisioning**    
  When phone service provider activates your account (sim card, phone number, etc.) after you purchase it.    
  
  
- **What is Service consumption?**  
  The activities performed by an organization (which may also be a single person) to consume the services.      
  Service consumption includes: management of consumer's resources that are needed to use the service (e.g. paying the bill regularly to make sure service stays working), all other actions that consumer performs to utilize the provider's resources (e.g. checking the email, making phone calls on the new phone), requesting new service actions to be fulfilled (e.g. request for data roaming), etc. When consumer is doing something - this is called service consumption.      
  
  
- **Who provides Service provision?**  
  Service provider.  
  
  
- **Who provides Service consumption?**    
  Service consumer.  
  
  
- **Are there any activities in Service relationship management scope provided by both (Service provider and Service consumer)?**    
  Yes, it is Service relationship management.  
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Management?**     
  The activities that the service provider and the service consumer do together to enable value co-creation to occur based upon the service offerings.      
  For example: Consumer pays bill on time so the Service provider has resources to continue providing the service.  
  Another example: Service provider informs Consumer about upcoming service upgrades, shortages, etc.   
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Model?**  
  !!!May be wrong!!! The model that considers every single service involved in Service relationship. A drawing (a model, a schema) contains every single relationship within the company and it's relationship to related service providers and consumers via Service offerings (Goods, Access to resources, Service actions).  
  For example, the model (e.g. diagram) containing all the relationships:    
  Google cloud provides services to a Video courses streaming platform,  
  Video courses streaming platform provides services to Video courses making company,      
  Video courses making company provides services to Subscribers,  
  Google has employees that are Subscribers.  
  
  
- **May organization be both a service provider and service consumer at the same time?**    
  Yes, it can be both at the same time.  
  It may be one at the time as well.  
 
  
- **What is Outcome?**  
  A result for a stakeholder, enabled by one or more outputs.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  


- **What is Outcome focused on: Service provider' desired outcome or Consumer's desired outcome?**  
  Consumer's desired outcome.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Affected outcomes or Supported outcomes?**  
  Supported outcomes.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Costs introduced or Costs removed?**  
  Costs removed.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Risks removed or Risks introduced?**   
  Risks removed.  
  
  
- **What are the three main components adding increasing Value?**  
  Supported outcomes, Costs removed, Risks removed.   
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What are the three main components decreasing Value?**    
  Affected outcomes, Costs introduced, Risks introduced.  
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What is Output?**    
  A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.    
  For example: a report, a bill at the end of the month, email, etc.   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Outcome and Output?**  
  Services facilitate outcomes **through** one or more outputs.    
  For example, video making company produces a video (output). The desired value video is targeted to achieve by the video is the outcome. So in this case, viewer passing the exam after watching the video may be the outcome here.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.      
  Output is part of the outcome.   
  
  
- **Should you care more about the outcome or an the output?**    
  You should care more about the **outcome** than the output.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.    
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  
  
  
- **What metrics should be defined: of Outcome or of Output?**    
  Both. Define metrics that measure outcomes and not just outputs.    
  If you will focus on output-only metrics then you may achieve output-related target but you may fail on achieving outcomes. Which may result to the entire business going down.    
  
  
- **What is Cost?**    
  The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource.   
  Cost may be measured financially, also in man-hours, full-time equivalents (FTEs), etc.  
  
  
- **What is FTE?**  
  Full-time equivalent (FTE) or whole time equivalent (WTE) is a unit that indicates the workload of an employed person (or student) in a way that makes workloads or class loads comparable across various contexts. FTE is often used to measure a worker's or student's involvement in a project, or to track cost reductions in an organization. An FTE of 1.0 is equivalent to a full-time worker or student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals half of a full work or school load.    
  One FTE equals 2000 hours of work per year.    
  
  
- **What are aims of Service provider in regards of costs when providing a service for a consumer?**    
  A service provider aims to **reduce or remove** costs for a consumer when providing a service.  
  
  
- **What is Risk?**    
  A possible event that could cause harm, loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.    
  
  
- **What is a service provider's goal in terms of risks when in relationship with a consumer (customer)?**    
  A service provider's goal should be to **reduce** risks for the consumer.  
  
  
- **Is risk potentially imposed on consumers by the service?**  
  Yes. **Risk** is potentially imposed on consumers by the service.    
  
  
- **Who should contribute to the reduction of risk potentially imposed by the service?**    
  Both: Service provider and Consumer.  
  For example, Uber. The service provider (in this case - Uber) has to be sure helpdesk is working well and the consumer should be sure the phone is charged, phone usage is possible, etc.  
  Another example with Uber. If the service of Uber does not work in your location you may communicate with Uber in regards of this inconvenience for you. Uber may then consider the issue and may take actions (or not) in order to improve their service for users like you.  
  It is up to a consumer to clearly communicate the needs to a service provider and clarify the outcomes he/she wants to achieve.  
  
  
- **What are the main points in regards of Consumer's communication to Service provider?**  
  1. Define the requirements of the service and clarify the required outcomes.  
  2. Clearly communicate any constraints and the critical success factors.  
  3. Consumers must ensure providers have access to the necessary resources.  
  
  
- **How can we deal with a Risk?**  
  Avoid  
  Accept  
  Transfer  
  Mitigate  
  
  
- **What is Risk avoidance?**  
  Risk avoidance involves removing risks from the service.    
  For example, ignoring GDPR regulation by not collecting any data mentioned in GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is Risk acceptance?**    
  Risk acceptance is used when the risk or cost is considered low.  
  For example, if you are outside of Europe you may choose to ignore GDPR regulations based on your own assumption that GDPR sanctions are applied heavily to business entities within Europe only.    
  
   
- **What is Risk transfer?**  
  Risk transfer is often used when you insure against a risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR you may want to hire someone else to collect, store and give the access to the data for you. This way the risk is transferred to another party.    
  Another example, in case of GDPR you may decide to buy an insurance and be paid by insurance company in case you get sue. This way the risk is transferred to insurance company.     
  
  
- **What is Risk mitigation?**    
  Risk mitigation is used when you implement technology or processes to reduce the risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR introduce the new software, hardware, and/or other upgrades helping to meet the requirements introduced with GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between an Outcome and a Requirement?**  
  **(????? NOT COMPLETE !!!!!!)**  
  Outcome - a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.  
  Requirement - ???  
  
  
- **What is Utility?**  
  Functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.      
  We may think about Utility in terms of "What the service does", "The way it performs", "Allows somebody to accomplish an outcome".  Or simply "Fit for purpose".      
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility.  
  
  
- **What is Warranty?**  
  Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.  
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  We may think about Warranty in terms of "How the service performs". Or simply "Fit for use".    
  For example, the web works - warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - utility.  
  
  
- **What considerations warranty addresses? Give a few examples.**   
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  
  
- **Is availability of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is capacity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.   
  
  
- **Is security levels of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is continuity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time -  a warranty.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between Utility and Warranty?**    
  Warranty is "fit for use"/"how the service performs" (for example, the brand new car is very good to drive from point A to point B) while Utility is "fit for purpose"/"what the service does" (but, for example, the car may not have enough space for the bigger family so it is not utility for the family).    
  For example, the server runs on elastic and powerful server - warranty,        
  Another example, car may drive from point A to point B - utility, how many miles per liter, how long the engine stays up, how cold or warm it gets inside, etc. - warranty.  
  
  
- **Which of two (utility, warranty) should a service have?**    
  A service should have both utility and warranty.  
  
  
- **What kind of conditions warranty requires?**  
  Warranty requires that a service has defined and agreed-upon conditions that are met.    
  Warranty requires a service supports the performance or removes constraints from consumers.    
  
  This suggests that a warranty is quite easy measurable. And this is why most of IT people like it.   
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility. That's why the service cannot be run successfully without both waranty and utility.
