- **What are the industrial revolutions, when it has happened, what each of it has to do with ITIL?**  
  1st industrial revolution. Around 18-19 centuries. Humanity moved from agrarian-based farmer societies into urbanized industrial area. Mechanization (iron, textile), steam (e.g. steam engines) and water power. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  2nd industrial revolution. Around WWI (1st WWorld War) we moved to mass production and electricity. For example, steal, oil, electricity, electric-powered equipment, cars with internal combustion engines, light bulb light replace candle light, communication across long distance became possible through the use of a telephone, etc. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  3rd industrial revolution (digital revolution). Around 1980s-1990s. Electronic and IT systems, automation. ITIL was starting in this period of time. ITIL ment Information Technology Infrastructure Library back then. (the name became not valid after ITILv4 release)  
  4th industrial revolution. Around early 21st century. It is happening now. Cyber physical systems in where we loose boundaries between physical and digital. For example: robotics, nano technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, autonomous cars,etc. ITIL4 is not an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, it is ITIL (just a brand name) for 4th industrial revolution. ITIL is for the entire service now.   
  
  
- **What is Service Organization?**    
  !!!THIS IS MY OWN ANSWER TAKEN FROM THE CONTEXT OF ITILv4 STUDY MATERIAL. THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. HOWEVER, I DO THINK IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR THE ITILv4 FOUNDATION CASE.!!!    
  It is an organization that is involved in services by any means.  
  Actually, Service management goes beyond services these days, we may probably call services "something".  
  
  
- **What is Service Management?**    
  A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling **value** to customers in the form of **services**.    
  ITIL 4 provides organizations with a comprehensive framework for IT service management.   
  
  
- **What is Governance?**  
  The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.  
  Each organization has a different process, for example to direct and control vacation requests of employees. The way an organization runs things is known as governance.    
  
  
 <!-- Service Management -->
  
  
- **What Organizational capability refers to in ITIL4?**  
  Organizational capability refers to having both the **capacity** and the **ability** to perform the functions required.  
  
  
- **What should organization do in order to perform the functions required?**    
  **Organize** people to best support the activities, practices, and processes. (None of these activities, practices, and processes could be done in isolation. Instead, organization should go through service management process.)    
  
  
- **What is Value?**  
  The **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.   
  
  
- **Who determines the perceived value?**  
  The recipient determines the perceived value.   
  Value is based on **recipient's** perception.  
  The example of orange:   
  1st case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten, peel (0% value) is thrown away. Total value - 100%   
  2nd case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (0% value) is thrown away, peel (100% value) is used for the cake. Total value - 100%  
  3rd case: Orange got by two people, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten by one person, peel (100% value) is used for the cake by another person. Total value - 200%    
  
  
- **Who creates the value?**   
  Value is **co-created** by the service provider and the consumer. Example certification course online - service provider should input the course, service consumer should take the course and successfully pass the exam after.  
  Value is **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.  
  Value perceived is determined by the recipient.    
  
  
- **What is Organization?**    
  A person or a group of people that has its own functions, responsibilities, and relationships to achieve its objectives.  
  Organizations vary in size, complexity, and in their legal structure.  
  
  
- **What are two basic roles an ORGANIZATION can fulfill?**   
  1. Service Provider (supplier)  
  2. Consumer  
  Service Provider (supplier) AND Consumer may be simultaneous (e.g. providing services, having partners to manage, buying materials from somewhere, etc.).  
  
  
- **What are three basic roles PEOPLE can fulfill?**   
  User  
  Customer  
  Sponsor  
  All these basic roles people in organization may fulfill (user, customer, sponsor) may by fulfilled by the same person (e.g. buying a new car to myself) or several people (e.g. buying the new car for own child/user when mom/customer is picking the car and dad/sponsor is giving money for it).  
  
  
- **May a disconnect between requirements, budget, and usability occur?**  
  Yes. A disconnect between requirements (customer), budget (sponsor), and usability (user) may occur. This kind of disconnection may cause problems because sponsor who funds the requirements and customer who creates these requirements often have arguments over what those requirement should be.      
  
  
- **What is Service Provider?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a service relationship to provide services to consumers.  
  
  
- **What is Consumer?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a relationship that uses (or consumes) those services.   
  
  
- **By which means organizations are bound together?**  
  Organizations are bound together by common objectives, relationships, and authorities.  
  People are **organized** around common goals *within* a larger business organization to achieve common objectives in a coordinated method.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: User?**  
  A person who uses services.  
  User ~ usability.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: Customer?**  
  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.   
  Customer ~ requirements.   
  
  
- **What is a role of: Sponsor?**    
  A person who authorizes the budget for service consumption.   
  Sponsor ~ budget (also:, efficiency, cost savings).  
  
  
- **What is our responsibility as a Service provider in regards of three basic user roles within the company?**    
  It is our responsibility to recognize these three generic roles on a consumer side, and work with them appropriately.    
  
  
- **What is Service?**  
  **Means of enabling value co-creation** by **facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve**, **without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks**.  
  Services may be based on products.  
  
  
- **What is the whole reason Consumer (customer) hires Service provider?**    
  Costs and risks passed to Service provider refers to the whole reason why a consumer (a customer) hires a service provider in the first place.  
  
  
- **Can service provider achieve outcomes for a consumer?**  
  A service provider **cannot** achieve outcomes for a consumer. Consumer has to achieve outcomes by their self.  
  Service provider is only able to facilitate the achievement of those customer outcomes.  
  For example, service provider may ensure the server is up and able to run the e-shop but if consumer do not provide necessary input steps then achieving desired outputs and eventually the outcomes are not possible.  
  
  
- **May services be based on products?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **What is Product?**  
  Configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for its customers.    
  Resources can be owned or managed by organization. Resources could be leased, or rented, could even be people working in organization, etc.    
  We may also think about it as a collection of services put together that provides more value together than they could individually.   
  A **product** is how an organization configures resources into an offer. For example, AWS has many service offerings but if you add these products into a set then it may become a product, e.g. Amazon lightsail.    
  A product **combines** and simplifies the various services.    
  
  
- **What is Service Offering**  
  A description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  
  
- **What can include Service offerings?**  
  Service offering can include:    
  Goods  
  Access to resources    
  Service actions   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Service, Product and Service offering?**    
  Terms:   
  Service - a description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  Product - "a configuration of an organization’s resources designed to offer value for a consumer."    
  Service offering - "a description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources, and service actions."    
  *My answer ("Close, but not quite right..."):*   
  Service - the smallest entity in the set of Service, Product, Service offering.    
  Product - a set of Services.   
  Service offering - a description of Service or Product.  
  *Jason's answer (The right answer):*  
  Service - think of it as something to provide for a need (like water service to your home). For example, internet service for your laptop.  
  Product - think of this as a "Thing". Something tanigible that you can touch. Your laptop is a product.  
  Service offering - a grouping of products and services offered to the customer (Maybe a laptop with a 4g cellular card and 2 years of free internet included, as an example).  
  
  
- **What are Goods?**  
  Things that are transferred from the Service provider to the Consumer, and then the Consumer is responsible for their future use.  
  For example: a phone from a service provider.   
  
  
- **What is Access to Resources?**  
  Access to resources are granted or licensed to a consumer under agreed terms and conditions.    
  For example: a paid membership on the website.  
  
  
- **What is Service action?**  
  Actions performed to address a consumer's needs.  
  For example: an additional support on using a web platform.  
  
    
- **What is Service Relationship?**  
  A cooperation between a Service provider and Service consumer including service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.    
  
  
- **What is Service provision?**  
  The activities performed by an organization to provide the services.    
  For example: managing service provider resources, configure them to deliver the services, providing access to the resources to the users, and fulfilling the agreed upon servuce actions, conducting service level management, performing continual improvement to the services, supplying good to the consumers, etc.    
  
    
- **Give at least one example of Account provisioning**    
  When phone service provider activates your account (sim card, phone number, etc.) after you purchase it.    
  
  
- **What is Service consumption?**  
  The activities performed by an organization (which may also be a single person) to consume the services.      
  Service consumption includes: management of consumer's resources that are needed to use the service (e.g. paying the bill regularly to make sure service stays working), all other actions that consumer performs to utilize the provider's resources (e.g. checking the email, making phone calls on the new phone), requesting new service actions to be fulfilled (e.g. request for data roaming), etc. When consumer is doing something - this is called service consumption.      
  
  
- **Who provides Service provision?**  
  Service provider.  
  
  
- **Who provides Service consumption?**    
  Service consumer.  
  
  
- **Are there any activities in Service relationship management scope provided by both (Service provider and Service consumer)?**    
  Yes, it is Service relationship management.  
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Management?**     
  The activities that the service provider and the service consumer do together to enable value co-creation to occur based upon the service offerings.      
  For example: Consumer pays bill on time so the Service provider has resources to continue providing the service.  
  Another example: Service provider informs Consumer about upcoming service upgrades, shortages, etc.   
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Model?**  
  !!!May be wrong!!! The model that considers every single service involved in Service relationship. A drawing (a model, a schema) contains every single relationship within the company and it's relationship to related service providers and consumers via Service offerings (Goods, Access to resources, Service actions).  
  For example, the model (e.g. diagram) containing all the relationships:    
  Google cloud provides services to a Video courses streaming platform,  
  Video courses streaming platform provides services to Video courses making company,      
  Video courses making company provides services to Subscribers,  
  Google has employees that are Subscribers.  
  
  
- **May organization be both a service provider and service consumer at the same time?**    
  Yes, it can be both at the same time.  
  It may be one at the time as well.  
 
  
- **What is Outcome?**  
  A result for a stakeholder, enabled by one or more outputs.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  


- **What is Outcome focused on: Service provider' desired outcome or Consumer's desired outcome?**  
  Consumer's desired outcome.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Affected outcomes or Supported outcomes?**  
  Supported outcomes.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Costs introduced or Costs removed?**  
  Costs removed.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Risks removed or Risks introduced?**   
  Risks removed.  
  
  
- **What are the three main components adding increasing Value?**  
  Supported outcomes, Costs removed, Risks removed.   
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What are the three main components decreasing Value?**    
  Affected outcomes, Costs introduced, Risks introduced.  
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What is Output?**    
  A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.    
  For example: a report, a bill at the end of the month, email, etc.   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Outcome and Output?**  
  Services facilitate outcomes **through** one or more outputs.    
  For example, video making company produces a video (output). The desired value video is targeted to achieve by the video is the outcome. So in this case, viewer passing the exam after watching the video may be the outcome here.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.      
  Output is part of the outcome.   
  
  
- **Should you care more about the outcome or an the output?**    
  You should care more about the **outcome** than the output.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.    
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  
  
  
- **What metrics should be defined: of Outcome or of Output?**    
  Both. Define metrics that measure outcomes and not just outputs.    
  If you will focus on output-only metrics then you may achieve output-related target but you may fail on achieving outcomes. Which may result to the entire business going down.    
  
  
- **What is Cost?**    
  The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource.   
  Cost may be measured financially, also in man-hours, full-time equivalents (FTEs), etc.  
  
  
- **What is FTE?**  
  Full-time equivalent (FTE) or whole time equivalent (WTE) is a unit that indicates the workload of an employed person (or student) in a way that makes workloads or class loads comparable across various contexts. FTE is often used to measure a worker's or student's involvement in a project, or to track cost reductions in an organization. An FTE of 1.0 is equivalent to a full-time worker or student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals half of a full work or school load.    
  One FTE equals 2000 hours of work per year.    
  
  
- **What are aims of Service provider in regards of costs when providing a service for a consumer?**    
  A service provider aims to **reduce or remove** costs for a consumer when providing a service.  
  
  
- **What is Risk?**    
  A possible event that could cause harm, loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.    
  
  
- **What is a service provider's goal in terms of risks when in relationship with a consumer (customer)?**    
  A service provider's goal should be to **reduce** risks for the consumer.  
  
  
- **Is risk potentially imposed on consumers by the service?**  
  Yes. **Risk** is potentially imposed on consumers by the service.    
  
  
- **Who should contribute to the reduction of risk potentially imposed by the service?**    
  Both: Service provider and Consumer.  
  For example, Uber. The service provider (in this case - Uber) has to be sure helpdesk is working well and the consumer should be sure the phone is charged, phone usage is possible, etc.  
  Another example with Uber. If the service of Uber does not work in your location you may communicate with Uber in regards of this inconvenience for you. Uber may then consider the issue and may take actions (or not) in order to improve their service for users like you.  
  It is up to a consumer to clearly communicate the needs to a service provider and clarify the outcomes he/she wants to achieve.  
  
  
- **What are the main points in regards of Consumer's communication to Service provider?**  
  1. Define the requirements of the service and clarify the required outcomes.  
  2. Clearly communicate any constraints and the critical success factors.  
  3. Consumers must ensure providers have access to the necessary resources.  
  
  
- **How can we deal with a Risk?**  
  Avoid  
  Accept  
  Transfer  
  Mitigate  
  
  
- **What is Risk avoidance?**  
  Risk avoidance involves removing risks from the service.    
  For example, ignoring GDPR regulation by not collecting any data mentioned in GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is Risk acceptance?**    
  Risk acceptance is used when the risk or cost is considered low.  
  For example, if you are outside of Europe you may choose to ignore GDPR regulations based on your own assumption that GDPR sanctions are applied heavily to business entities within Europe only.    
  
   
- **What is Risk transfer?**  
  Risk transfer is often used when you insure against a risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR you may want to hire someone else to collect, store and give the access to the data for you. This way the risk is transferred to another party.    
  Another example, in case of GDPR you may decide to buy an insurance and be paid by insurance company in case you get sue. This way the risk is transferred to insurance company.     
  
  
- **What is Risk mitigation?**    
  Risk mitigation is used when you implement technology or processes to reduce the risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR introduce the new software, hardware, and/or other upgrades helping to meet the requirements introduced with GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between a desired Outcome and a Requirement?**   
  "Outcome - a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.  
  Requirement - a thing that is needed or wanted; a necessary condition.  
  
  So, these are closely tied together, but they are (not?) the exact same thing. Requirements are set by one side, as you said. For example, if I am hiring you to build a website for me, I get to set the requirements. I may say that the site must provide enough service to support 10k users. That is my requirement.  
  Now, how you go about doing that (will you build it on a Linux or Windows server, what programming language, etc) is up to you as the service provider.  
  We both want the same thing though: "A website that can handled up to 10k users at a time." But, that is really an output, not an outcome.  
  The outcome would be that our end users are happy because the site is properly supporting their needs.  
  When we think of requirements, they are usually tied to "warranty" of a given service. These can add to the outcome when they are met, but they aren't the outcome themselves."    
  
  
- **What is Utility?**  
  Functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.      
  We may think about Utility in terms of "What the service does", "The way it performs", "Allows somebody to accomplish an outcome".  Or simply "Fit for purpose".      
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility.  
  
  
- **What is Warranty?**  
  Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.  
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  We may think about Warranty in terms of "How the service performs". Or simply "Fit for use".    
  For example, the web works - warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - utility.  
  
  
- **What considerations warranty addresses? Give a few examples.**   
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  
  
- **Is availability of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is capacity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.   
  
  
- **Is security levels of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is continuity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time -  a warranty.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between Utility and Warranty?**    
  Warranty is "fit for use"/"how the service performs" (for example, the brand new car is very good to drive from point A to point B) while Utility is "fit for purpose"/"what the service does" (but, for example, the car may not have enough space for the bigger family so it is not utility for the family).    
  For example, the server runs on elastic and powerful server - warranty,        
  Another example, car may drive from point A to point B - utility, how many miles per liter, how long the engine stays up, how cold or warm it gets inside, etc. - warranty.  
  
  
- **Which of two (utility, warranty) should a service have?**    
  A service should have both utility and warranty.  
  
  
- **What kind of conditions warranty requires?**  
  Warranty requires that a service has defined and agreed-upon conditions that are met.    
  Warranty requires a service supports the performance or removes constraints from consumers.    
  
  This suggests that a warranty is quite easy measurable. And this is why most of IT people like it.   
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility. That's why the service cannot be run successfully without both waranty and utility.    
  
  
- **Could "four dimensions of service management" be called "four perspectives of service management"?**  
  Yes, it could.  
  
  
- **What is in the center of four different dimensions of service management?**  
  The value is in the center. It is the value we want to co-create by using different products and services deliverable by a service provider to a consumer/customer.  
  
  
- **What are the four different dimensions of service management?**  
  - Organizations and people
  - Information and technology
  - Partners and suppliers  
  - Value streams and processes
  
  
- **Name external factors (at least six of them) that impact value co-creation.**  
  - Political factors  
  - Economical factors  
  - Social factors  
  - Technological factors  
  - Legal factors  
  - Environmental factors  


- **What tend to be the difference between horizontal (flat) and vertical organization hierarchies in terms of agility?**  
  - Horizontal structures tend to be more agile  
  - Vertical structures tend to be more process driven  
  
  
- **Which of organizational structures (vertical or horizontal) tend to be more process driven?**  
  - Horizontal structures tend to be more agile  
  - Vertical structures tend to be more process driven  
  
  
- **What is culture (e.g. of organization)?**  
  Culture - shared values and attitudes of the organization.  
    
  
- **Is culture starting at the top and funnels down throughout the company, or is it starting from the bottom?**  
  Culture starts at the top and funnels down throughout the company.  
  
  
- **Name couple of worries in regards of topics related to Organizations and People?**  
  - How will we form our organizational structures to support the services and products we want to deliver?  
  - How do we set an organization?  
    For example:  
      - Formal organization types: sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, multi-level conglomerate, other?  
      - Where it will be based: America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa? What country?     
    
  - How will it gonna function?  
    For example:  
      - Organizational hierarchies (vertical or horizontal/flat?)  
      - How do we break up the company (departments, functions)  
      - Finding right people (HR, then managers and leaders for departments, then more and more right people)  
      - Continual training development of your workforce is important: skills, competences, etc.  
      - Roles and responsibilities (single or multiple hats, etc.)  
    
  - What kind of culture it gonna have?  
    For example:  
      - Values, Mission, Vision  
      - Communication (formal/informal, in person/by email, trust/transparency of the top leader plans, vision share/not, goals share/not, values/mission/vision advocates, etc.)  
      - Individual people (leadership style, somehow different mission, vision. values, etc.)  
  
  - How to take care of people so the people can deliver products and services  
    For example:  
      - Communication with people inside and outside the organization, sharing of knowledge and specializations  
      - How do we facilitate value creation?  
      
  - etc.
  
  
- **What does Technology support?**  
  - IT Service. For example, for Uber that may be the mobile app.  
  - IT Service Management. Technology that supports IT Service Management ensures the business can function properly. For example, intranet.    
  
  Sometimes the technology may be used in both areas.  
  
  
- **Give at least one example of service where information management is the primary means of enabling customer value.**  
  For example, the newspaper that's online - delivering information.  
  Another example, data analytics publishing their results.  
  
  
- **Name at least 6 factors that the information is judged by**    
  - Availability  
  - Reliability  
  - Accessibility  
  - Timeliness  
  - Accuracy  
  - Relevance  
  
  
- **Name at least two challenges information management has.**  
  - Security  
  - Regulatory compliance requirements  
  
  
- **What are the considerations we should be thinking of when looking at Information and Technology?**  
  - Is it compatible with the current **architecture**? Will it gonna work with the technology we are currently using?  
  - Does it raise any regulatory, compliance, or information security control **issues**?  
  - Will it continue to be **viable** in the foreseeable future?  
  - Does it align with the service provider or service consumer **strategy**?  
  - Does the organization have the right **skills** to support and maintain the technology?  
  - Does it have enough **automation** capabilities to be developed, deployed, and operated?  
  - Does it have additional **capabilities** that can be leveraged for other products or services?  
  - Does it introduce new **risks** or **constraints** to the organization?  
  
  
- **May organizational culture have an impact on a risk tolerance?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **Why "Organizations and people" is not the same as "Partners and suppliers" on four dimensions of service management?**  
  "Organizations and people" - internal focus.  
  "Partners and suppliers" - external focus.  
  
  
- **Why "Partners" and "Suppliers" from "Partners and suppliers" on four dimensions of service management are not put into the one single merged term?**  
  "Partners" and "Suppliers" are not the same.  
  Therefore there are two different externally focused strategies: partner strategy, supplier strategy.  
  Partner relationship is about the services that are more critical to the business. We want to be as much involved into partner's evolution-life as possible, we may want to share plans, road maps, etc. We will share common goals and risks with partners, we will collaborate to achieve desired outcomes, we want both brands to be valuable, employers to be happy, etc. Partners are used for critical business functions and in-depth relationships.    
  Suppliers relationship is about the services that are not so critical. E.g. regular tools for office use. Suppliers relationship may be done through formal contracts, clear separation of roles and responsibilities ("I pay for this, you do this", "I ask you for this, you deliver this", etc.). Suppliers are used for commodities and from organizations you simply buy things from. (Another example is my Internet Service Provider. I buy my service from them, but they don't share with me their product development roadmap or integrate into my business, therefore they are a supplier.).    
  
  Your organization's strategy (partners, suppliers, also integrators of all) is based upon its goals, culture, and business environment.  
  
  
- **Is outsourced function considered to be a "Partner relationship" or more of "Suppliers relationship"?**  
  Supplier, not a partnership.  
  
  
- **What influences the supplier strategy, name a few topics we should care about when working on the supplier strategy getting ready?**  
  - Price  
  - Quality  
  - Reliability  
  - Track record  
  - Shareability  
  
  
- **What is a concept of Service integration?**  
  Service integration are a few things tighten together in order to deliver the service.  
  For example, video lectures delivering company may have: video service, store front, website, cloud hosting.  
  
  
- **Who deals with Service integration?**  
  - For example, where ony few partners and suppliers exists: Service integration and management might be kept **within** the organization.  
  - Another example, with lots of partners and suppliers: Service integration and management may also be delegated to a **service integrator**.  
    Now, with an integrator, the integrator is a partner to you, but they are coordinating all the individual suppliers on your behalf. I need to share my plans with the integrators (partnership), but I don't care about who the underlying suppliers are that they choose to use necessarily.  
    These integrators are kind of **a "strange" hybrid of a partner and a supplier**, but if I had to put them into one of those two categories, I would say they are more of a partner because they are deeply going to be embedded into your critical business functions.  
    For the exam, when they talk about partners and suppliers, though, they won't go into the service integrators (because they don't fit cleanly into one of the two categories). This was an area we needed to cover for the course, though, to make sure students understood the functions of these critical players in large IT projects that you will experience in the real world.  
  
  
- **What is Service Integration and Management about?**  
  (These are processes) involving the use of specially established integrators to ensure that service relationships are properly coordinated.  
  
  
- **Is it so that EVERY organization relies on other partners and suppliers?**  
  Yes. **Every** organization relies on other partners and suppliers.  
    

- **What Value Streams and Processes define?**  
  Define the activities, workflows, controls and procedures needed to achieve the agreed upon objectives.  
  More precisely this would be:  
  - The activities undertaken  
  - How activities are organized  
  - How value creation is ensured  
  
  
- **What is Value Stream?**  
  A series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to service consumers.    
  In every step we do there are value-adding activities and non value-adding activities (waste).  
  In business we want to increase value adding activities and to get rid of non value-adding activities.  
  
  
- **What Value Stream activities we want to automate?**  
  We want to optimize value stream so we can minimize the amount of non value-adding activities while increasing value adding activities. We want to automate this process as much as possible afterwards.  
  
  
- **What should be done first: optimization or automation?**  
  Optimize then automate.  
  
  
- **What is Process?**  
  A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs.  
  Processes are designed to achieve a specific objective.  
  A well-defined **process** can improve productivity, be optimized, and then become automated.  
  
  
- **What is the point of questioning: What is the generic delivery model for the service and how does the service work?**  
  This describes which processes do we put together so the value stream works.  
  
  
- **What questions are worth to be asked/considered when defining Value Stream?**  
  - What is the **generic delivery model** for the service and how does the service work?  
  - What are the value streams involved in delivering the agreed **outputs** of the service?  
  - **Who** or what will perform the required service **actions**?  
  
  
- **What is PESTLE model?**  
  Generic open-source model that stands for the acronym of PESTLE:  
  - P - Political  
  - E - Economic  
  - S - Social  
  - T - Technological  
  - L - Legal  
  - E - Environmental  
  These are 6 external factors that you cannot control. They gonna happen to you.  
  However, these are the external factors you have to take into account when designing your services and products.  
  PESTLE model describes factors that constrain or influence how a service provider can operate.  
  For example,  
  UBER: Social (people should get used to the new taxi service model),  
  Technological (willing to create a quantum-resistant encryption - quantum computers do not exist yet..),  
  etc.  
  
  
- **How many PESTLE factors may affect one of four different dimensions of service management?**  
  Every dimension is affected by multiple factors.  
  
  
- **Give an example applying four dimensions of service management?**  
  Let's take Incident management as an example.  
  - Organizations and People:  
    - Will service desk handle it?  
    - Or will there be Tier1, Tier2, Tier3 support?  
    - Or will it be a flat organization?  
    - How will we organize our communications? E.g. How Tier1 collected information will transfer to Tier2, and so on. How it all will be escalated to the next level?    
    - How many people do we need for a particular service incident management? What competences do they need? Any certified people on-board? e.g. if we use AWS we may need AWS certified people. What about people qualifications?  
    - How people will interact? Who/how we are going to motivate people?  
    - How do we gonna hire the new people?  
    - How do we keep the right people?  
    - How do we pay people?  
    - How will we make sure people are capable of doing incident management we want them to do?  
    - etc.  
  - Information and Technology  
    - How will I register the incident? Writing down on the paper? Registering into internet portal? Any special software and hardware involved?  
    - How between relationships between incidents? How do I know that one incident that happened today is related to the one that happened before? Any technology/software managing and tracking incident relationships? What about incidents and different items? What about incidents relationship to users affected?  
    - What about incident management tools for incident management flow? How will we do the workflow? How will we use knowledge bases?  
    - What about diagnostic tools?  
    - How will we detect and process events for incident management?  
    - How will we communicate with each other?  
    - How will we organize and share data?  
    - etc.  
  - Partners and Suppliers  
    - Maybe suppliers do not do a good job anymore because of some internal issues they experience and we need to consider a new contract?  
    - If we outsource services, how will we gonna escalate incidents to them once something is broken?  
    - Or maybe we manage minor issues and we escalate Tier2 or Tier3 issues to outsourced teams? How do we get information back when the issue is solved? Should other suppliers and partenrs be notified somehow?  
  - Value Streams and Processes  
    - Is the process optimized properly? Is there not too much waste in steps?  
  - PESTLE  
    - Maybe somebody hijacks the system because of values mismatch? For example, printer is always stuck because somebody things we should not print because we hurt environment.  
  
  
- **What is Service Value System (SVS)?**  
  Describes how all the components and activities of the organization work together as a system to enable value co-creation.  
  SVS may be configured and reconfigured in multiple combinations of organization resources.  
  SVS require **integration** and **coordination** of activities, practices, teams, authorities, and responsibilities.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Value System?**  
  The purpose is to ensure that the organization continually co-creates value with all stakeholders through the use and management of products and services.  
  
  
- **What are the three main basic blocks Service value system is made of?** 
  - Opportunity and demand (that's input)
  - Processes/activities (these are: Guiding principles, Governance, **Service value chain**, 34 Practices, Continual improvement)
  - Value (that's output)
  

- **What do Opportunities represent?**  
  Opportunities represent options or possibilities to add value for stakeholders or otherwise improve the organization.  
  E.g. find new markets, new customers, create new products, etc.  
  
  
- **What is Demand?**  
  Demand is the need or desire for products and services among internal and external consumers.  
  
  
- **What is the output of the Service Value System?**  
  Value is the outcome.  
  
  
- **What does System value system enable?**  
  Enables the creation of many different types of **value** for a wide group of stakeholders.  
  
  
- **Is ITIL 4 directive framework (you must follow) or best practices framework (you may follow)?**  
  ITIL 4 is best practices, not directive framework.    
  
  
- **What is Guiding Principle?**  
  !!! A recommendation that guides an organization in **ALL** circumstances.  
  !!! So this is also the reason why it all allows organizations to **integrate** them into an overall approach to service management.  
  !!! Guiding principles are applied **universally** to any initiative, all relationships with different stakeholder groups.  
  !!! Guiding principles support and encourage organizations in **continual improvement**.  
  !!! You should consider which of the guiding principles are **relevant** to your situation. Not all the principles are critical to every situation.  
  
  
- **What are 7 guiding principles in ITIL 4?**  
  - Focus on value (value for consumer, customer, service provider, etc.  )  
  - Start where you are  
  - Progress iteratively with feedback  
  - Collaborate and promote visibility  
  - Think and work holistically  
  - Keep it simple and practical  
  - Optimize and automate  
  
  
- **What does "Focus on value" guiding principle state?**  
  Everything the organization does should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Focus on value" (e.g. in four steps)?**  
  1. Understand and identify the service consumer  
  2. Understand the consumer's perspective of value  
  3. Map value to intended outcomes which **change** over time  
  4. Understand the customer experience or user experience  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Focus on value" (e.g. mention key factors when looking at application)?**  
  1. Know how your consumers and customers will use each service  
  2. Encourage a focus on value among the entire staff
  3. Focus on value during operational activity and during improvement activities
  4. Include a focus on value in every step of any improvement initiative
  
  
- **What does "Start where you are" guiding principle say?**   
  Don't start over without first considering what is already available to be leveraged.  
  Decisions on how to proceed should be based on **accurate** information.  
  Measurement should be used to **support** the analysis of what has been observed rather than to replace it.  
  Measuring can affect the results. E.g. Drive through restaurants may put you aside "wait in there we will come back to you in few minutes" in case you caused the delay (most likely ~30 seconds) for any reason and the staff is being measured by the time per order. The staff will then most likely mark your order as complete and come back to you when busy moment will pass by.  
  
  
- **What Goodhart's law states?**  
  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.  
  The original formulation by Charles Goodhart was: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes."  
  Therefore, measure your outcomes, not your outputs.  (because: people will start to hack any system on the way to just meet the targeted measure-based goal, almost no matter what)  
  
  
- **What should we measure: outputs or outcomes?**  
  Outcomes, not outputs.  
  (because: people will start to hack any system on the way to just meet the targeted measure-based goal, almost no matter what; learn more by browsing for Goodhart's law)  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Start where you are" (e.g. in four steps)?**  
  1. Look at what exists as objectively as possible  
  2. Determine if successful practices or services can be replicated or expanded  
  3. Apply your risk management in the decision making process  
  4. Recognize that sometimes nothing from your current state can be reused  
  
  
- **What does "Progress Iteratively with Feedback" principle say?**  
  Working in a time-boxed and iterative manner with embedded feedback loops allows for greater flexibility, faster responses to needs, the ability to respond to failure earlier, and an overall improvement in quality.  
  This is more about working on Agile principles.  
  Organize work into smaller or more manageable **sections**.  
  !!! Couple of benefits:  Sequential or simultaneous; Manageable and managed; Tangible results; Timely manner; **Build future improvements**;  
  
  
- **Describe "Feedback loop, what is it?"**  
  Occurs when part of the output of an activity is used as a new input.  
  Each of the parts must be continually **reevaluated** to accurately reflect changes in the circumstances.  
  !!! Utilize **feedback** before, throughout, and after each iteration.   
  !!! **Understand** where work comes from, where outputs go, and how actions affect outcomes.  
   
  
- **How do we apply "Progress Iteratively with Feedback" (e.g. in four steps)?**   
  1. Comprehend the whole process and do something.   
  2. Feedback is essential to a constantly changing ecosystem.   
  3. Fast does not equate to incomplete.  
  
  
- **What does "Collaborate and Promote Visibility" principle say?**  
  Puts the right people in the correct roles, achieve better buy-in, have more relevance, and gain an increased likelihood of long-term success.  
  Collaboration is about working together. For example, sharing information, building trust, building understanding, etc. For example, if our department builds something that will affect another department then we want to collaborate.  
  Collaboration increases visibility: within the team, between teams, between service provider and consumer, etc.  
  **Lack of collaboration might create an impression that the work is not a priority.**  Especially when, for example, improvement work is taking a lower priority over other tasks with daily urgency.  
  A lack of visibility leads to **poor** decision making.  
  
  
- **Does collaboration increase visibility?**  
  Yes. Collaboration increases visibility.  
  
  
- **Does a lack of visibility lead to poor decision making?**  
  Yes. A lack of visibility leads to poor decision making.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Collaborate and Promote Visibility" (e.g. in four steps)?**  
  - Understand the flow of work  
  - Identify bottlenecks  
  - Identify excess capacity  
  - Uncover waste  
  
  To also keep in mind:  
  - Collaboration does not necessarily mean consensus. Because at the end of the day there is often that somebody who drives the decision.    
  - Communicate in the way the audience can hear. E.g. Do not use "bits and bytes" talk while communicating to marketing.  
  - Decisions can only be made on visible data  
  
  
- **What does "Think and Work Holistically" principle say?**  
  A holistic approach to service management requires an understanding of how all the parts of an organization work together in an integrated way.  
  When you have a **holistic** understanding, you know how something works from end to end.  
  Therefore it is important to use all four dimensions of IT service management in order to have a good holistic overview of how the service works. In case the holistic view of the service becomes important, it is important to look at the input, service value chain (guiding principles / governance / service value chain / practices / continual improvement), desired outcome.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Think and Work Holistically"**  
  - Recognize the complexity of the systems, including different inputs, outputs, exceptions, impact of/to other systems.  
  - Collaboration is key to thinking and working holistically. How all of it is being achieved through the entire living cycle of the system itself, information that travels through, etc?  
  - Look for patterns of interactions between system elements. For example, what systems is responsible for what functions? What functions systems cover? Are there any functions that repeat? Are there any functions lacking? Etc.  
  - Automation can help you to work more holistically  
  
  
- **What does "Keep it Simple and Practical" principle say?**   
  Outcome-based thinking should be used to produce practical solutions which deliver valuable outcomes using minimum number of steps.   
  In order to establish "Simple and Practical", we need to establish a **holistic** view of the organization's work.  
  Start with an **uncomplicated** approach.  
  **Do not** try to produce a solution for every exception.  
  Be mindful of how we can complete the **objectives** - this is important reason of why do we need "Keep it Simple and Practical" as such.  
  By doing few things we can do it very well and very fast.  
  Doing less things leads to mastering these few skills, gaining professionalism.  
  "Keep it Simple and Practical" is a good way to achieve quick wins.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Keep it Simple and Practical", where do we start from?**  
  Start with an **uncomplicated** approach - the fewest amount of steps possible. This is because we want to minimize the risk of something breaking apart.  
  
  
- **What do we do with exceptions in case we apply "Keep it Simple and Practical"?**  
  **Do not** try to produce a solution for every exception. Common solutions - first.   
  However, be mindful of how we can complete the **objectives** - it is important.  
  By doing few things we can do it very well and very fast.  
  
  
- **Which of the guiding principles will most likely to be be implemented the last one?**  
  Optimize and Automate.  
  
  
- **What does "Optimize" mean in "Optimize and Automate" guiding principle?**  
  Make something as effective and useful as it makes sense to do.  
  By optimizing things, we tend to pull in areas from all the other guiding principles.  
  
  
- **What does "Automation" mean in "Optimize and Automate" guiding principle?**  
  Using technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently with limited or no human intervention.  
  Automate frequent and repetitive tasks.  
  For example, automate the most frequent and already optimized well working problem solving tasks.  
  Simplest form of automation involves standardizing and streamlining manual tasks.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Optimize and Automate" guiding principle in 3 steps?**  
  1. Simplify and/or optimize before automating. We want to optimize few steps only, not thousands at once.  
  2. Define your metrics  
  3. Use the other guiding principles when applying this one  
  
  
- **What is Service Value Chain made of?**  
  - Plan  
  - Engage - Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support  -> Products & Services  
  - Improve  
  
  
- **What is the difference between Service Value Chain and Service Value System inner parts?**  
  Service Value System is made of:  
  - Opportunity and demand (that's input)  
  - Processes/activities (these are: Guiding principles, Governance, **Service value chain**, 34 Practices, Continual improvement)  
  - Value (that's output)  
  While Service Value Chain is made of non-linear chain of events:  
  - Plan  
  - Engage - Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support  -> Products & Services  
  - Improve  
  p.s. "Products & Services" is not an event, nor activity. The six activities within the service value chain are plan, improve, engage, design and transition, obtain/build, and deliver and support.  
  p.p.s. Pay attention that activities outside of Service Value Chain scope (e.g. Opportunity and demand, Value, Governance, etc.) are not considered Service Value Chain Activities!   
  Activities outside of Service Value Chain scope are inputs and outputs to Service Value Chain activities (e.g. Opportunity and demand may be an input/output for/of Improve)  
  
  
- **What is called Central Activities inside Service Value Chain?**  
  These are 3 activities that can interact with each other and other activities outside the scope in any order. These are Central Activities inside Service Value Chain:  
  Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support  
  
  
- **What is the the difference between ITIL v3 and ITIL v4 Service Value Chains?**   
  ITIL v3 Service Value Chain (originally called "Service Value Cycle") was linear: Service Strategy -> Service Design -> Service Transition -> Service Operation -> Continual Service Improvement -> and all goes again to Service Design -> etc.  
  ITIL v4 Service Value Chain is non-linear sequence. We normaly start from Engage (but we don't have to). And then we touch Central activities inside the Service Value Chain: Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support.  
  
  
- **Does Service Value Chain use interactions between practices?**  
  Yes, it does.  
  
  
- **How does each activity contribute to the Service Value Chain?**  
  Each activity contributes to the service value chain by transforming specific inputs into outputs.  
  Service value chain activities use different **combinations** of the 34 ITIL practices.  
  Each activity may use third party resources, different skills, competences, etc. from one of these 34 practices.  
  All 34 practices don't have to be done individually, they may be combined together too.  
  
  
- **How many ITIL 4 practices there are?**  
  34  
  
  
- **All incoming and outgoing interactions are performed through the X activity of Service Value Chain. Whhat is X?**  
  Engage  
  

- **All new resources are obtained through the X activity of Service Value Chain. What is X?**  
  Obtain/build  
  
  
- **Planning at all levels is performed via X activity of Service Value Chain. What is X?**  
  Plan  
    
  
- **Improvements at all levels are initiated and managed through the X activity of Service Value Chain. What is X?**  
  Improve  
  
  
- **What is Plan activity of Service Value Chain is about?**  
  (ITIL v3 had a "Strategy" that is kind of part of ITIL v4 "Plan" activity)   
  Ensures a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organization.  
  Inputs to the Plan activity are:  
  - Policies, requirements, and constraints provided by the organization's **governance** body.  
  - Consolidated demands and opportunities provided by **engage**.  
  - Value chain performance information, improvement initiatives, plans, and status provided by **improve**  
  - Information about new and changed products and services from **design & transition** and **obtain/build**.  
  Outputs of the Plan activity:  
  - **Creates** 3 types of plans: strategic (big, e.g. a roadmap for next 3 year - kind of vision), tactical (mid, e.g. in a next year we gonna do this and that), and operational (small, e.g. we will do that small part of tactical plan in these and these steps) plans.    
  - Portfolio decisions, architecture, and policy are sent to **design & transition** (e.g., we are moving to cloud - we should stop building new server farm activities, and we should build cloud infrastructure, e.g. moving all to AWS).  
  - Feedback on improvement opportunities to **improve**  
  - Product and service portfolio, contract requirements, and agreement requirements to **engage** (e.g. we produce a roadmap of our services and we go to consumers and other providers to figure out how we can build it)  
   
  
- **What is Improve activity of Service Value Chain is about?**  
  Ensures continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities (Plan - // Engage - Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support  -> Products & Services // - Improve) and the four dimensions of service management (Organizations and people; Information and technology; Partners and suppliers; Value streams and processes).  
  Inputs:  
  - Product and service performance information from **deliver & support**  
  - Stakeholders' (e.g. consumers, suppliers, etc.) feedback from **engage**  
  - Performance information and improvement opportunities from **all value chain activities**  (Plan - // Engage - Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support  -> Products & Services // - Improve)   
  - Knowledge and information about new and changed products and services from **design & transition** and **obtain/build**  
  - Knowledge and information about third-party components from **engage** (engage-related examples: partners, suppliers, etc. for example, they are moving from Amazon to Azure)  
  Outputs:  
  - Improvement initiatives and plans for **all value chain activities**  
  - Value chain performance information from **plan** and the governing body  
  - Improvement status reports for **all value chain activities**  
  - Contract and agreement requirements for **engage**  
  - Service performance information for **design & transition**  
  
  
- **What is Engage activity of Service Value Chain is about?**  
  Provides a good understanding of stakeholder needs, continual engagement, and transparency, and maintains good relationships with all stakeholders  
  You may think about the engage as "going out ant talking to other people (internally, externally)", the basic question we ask ourselves here is "who needs to know ... ?"  
  You may also think about engage as "the process that makes communication happen"

- **What are Value streams?**  
  Specific combinations of activities and practices, and each one is designed for a particular scenario.  
  Each **value stream** is made up of a different combination of value chain activities.  
  The service value chain's **strength** is the interrelationships throughout the process.  
  
  
- **Why is continual improvement treated as a practice (one of 34) and Process/activity of Service Value System?**  
  In general, continual improvement is a practice. Moreover, continual improvement is very important compared to all 34 practices therefore it is mentioned as a practice (within 34 practices) and as a process/activity (inside Service Value System). In everything we do, we should be trying to improve.    
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement practice about?**  
  This practice aligns the organization's practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing identification and improvement of services, service components, practices, or any element involved in the efficient and effective management of products and services.  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model?**  
  It is a 7 step methodology that provides us a framework on how we should do improvement operations within our organizations. Those 7 steps are:  
  - What is the vision? => Business vision, mission, goals and objectives  
  - Where are we now? => Perform baseline assessments  
  - Where do we want to be? => Define measurable targets  
  - How do we get there? => Define the improvement plan  
  - Take action. => Execute improvement actions  
  - Did we get there? => Evaluate metrics and KPIs  
  - How do we keep the momentum going? (and all starts again)  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "What is the vision?" about?**  
  **In short**, it is business vision, mission, goals and objectives.  
  Vision focuses on 2 key areas:  
  1. Translating the vision and objectives so that the context is understood.    
  2. Create a high-level vision for the planned improvement.  
  Vision is gonna come from C-seat, e.g. the CEO, the CFO, the CIO, or others.  
  Each improvement initiative should **support** the organization's goals and objectives.  
  Vision makes the following clearly understood:  
  - Know the high-level direction  
  - Describe planned improvement  
  - Identify stakeholders and roles  
  - Agree upon the expected value  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "WWhere are we now?" about?**  
  **In short**, perform baseline assessments.      
  You need to know your **starting point** to properly plan out your journey.  
  Conduct a **current state assessment** of the existing services by determining:  
  - what the user's perception of the value is for our services  
  - what existing skills and competencies our workforce has for our services  
  - what processes and procedures are involve in delivering those services  
  - what are our technical capabilities  
  - what is our organization culture and the prevailing attitudes of the employees  
  We will build a baseline (real numbers, data) for all of this and more to determine - to determine the "Where are we now" point.  
  REMEMBER: It is difficult to track and measure any effectiveness of your improvement initiatives if you never determine where you started from.  
  
  
- **What is Baseline (in context of "Where are we now" step of "Continual improvement" practice)?**  
  Report or metric that serves as a starting point against which progress or change can be assessed.  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "Where do we want to be?" about?**  
  **In short**, define measurable targets.  
  We are about to define where do we want to be in a long term and in a short one too - by using Gap Analysis.  
  
  
- **What is Gap analysis (in context of "Where do we want to be?" step of "Continual improvement" practice)?**  
  A method to evaluate the scope and nature of the distance to be travelled from the starting point to the achievement of the initiative's vision.  
  In IT world, the Gap Analysis is based on **metrics** such as the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and CSFs (Critical Success Factors).  
  It is important: the vision may be **aspirational** and never truly achieved but this is ok - the point is to move forward as fast and as close as possible. Therefore we may need to define smaller steps, introduce more/other sensitive metrics, etc.  
  In short: Set our goals and agree to metrics such as KPIs and CSFs.  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "How do we get there?" about?**  
  **In short**, define the improvement plan.  
  Create your plan.  
  It is ok if you don't know the way to reach the objectives because sometimes extra experiments should be made on the way to answer which way to go further. Plan the experiments, draw the further path to "Where do we want to be".  
  Check **progress** after each iteration of your plan.  
  Important: "If you don't have a plan, you are planning to fail."  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "Take Action" about?**  
  **In short**, execute improvement actions.  
  Use any methodology you want, e.g. Waterfall, Agile, DevOps. Lean, etc.  
  - Measure progress towards the vision  
  - Manage the risk during those changes    
  - Ensure the visibility of the initiative is spread throughout the organization  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "Did we get there?" about?**  
  **In short**, evaluate metrics and KPIs.  
  It involves checking our new "normal". Basically, comparing "Where are we today" with "Where are we now". This way we measure if we did a positive or a negative achievement.  
  Just setting the plan how to get from point A to point B and taking the action is not enough therefore it is not a good idea to jump on another initiative start without monitoring the existing one for "Did we get there?".  
  Success is **not** guaranteed.  Therefore it must be measured and must be validated.  
  Conduct the **current state** assessment again.  
  
  
- **What is Continual improvement model step "How do we keep the momentum going?" about?**  
  Attempt to **continue** the improvement gains across the organization.  
  This is our main goal - constant continual improvement. This model is cyclical in nature - going round and round, again and again, reaching more efficiencies, more effectiveness, more value, etc.  
  
  
- **Do guiding principles apply to all steps of Continual improvement process?**  
  Guiding principles applies to all levels, but some are more better suited for specific steps of Continual improvement steps.  
  
  
- **Which of 7 guiding principles are better suited for Continual improvement model step "What is the vision?"?**

- **During which step of the continual improvement model is change management and release management usually performed?**  
  Take action.  
  The 'take action' step of the continual improvement model is focused on performing the actual work involved in order to reach the goals set forth in the 'where do we want to be' step. To do this, change management is used to implement a change in the environment and release management is used to make new and changed features available for use.  
  
  
- **To which categories all 34 ITIL4 practices are divided?**  
  - (14) General management  
  - (17) Service management  
  - (3) Technical management  
  
  
- **What is Practice?**  
  A set of organized resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.  
  Each practice supports multiple Service Value Chain activities and includes resources based on the 4 dimensions of IT service management.  
  
  
- **What does "General management practices" mean?**  
  General management practices - management practices that have been adopted and adapted for service management in more general business management domains.  
  For example, project management and portfolio management is not something that occurs in IT projects only, it is spread across all business domains.  
  
  
- **What Continual improvement practice is focusing on?**  
  1. Encourage continual improvement across the organization.  
  2. Secure time and budget for continual improvement.  
  3. Identify and log improvement opportunities.  
  4. Assess and prioritize improvement opportunities.  
  5. Make a valid business case for improvement action.  
  6. Plan, implement, measure, and evaluate the results.  
  7. Coordinate improvement activities across the organization.  
  
  
- **Would you be able to name what is inside "Continual improvement" practice toolbox (methods, models, techniques)?**  
  - Lean methods - for reducing waste  
  - Multi-phase projects - for organising the way we are going to do things and get incremental improvements  
  - Maturity assessments - for figuring out how mature our organization is, and are we operating at the peak efficiency  
  - DevOps (Development Ops) - for developing things quicker and getting them into market faster  
  - Balanced Scorecard - for example, for looking at the improvement through the lens of 4 different dimensions of service management (Organizations and people, Information and technology, Partners and suppliers, Value streams and processes)  
  - Agile - quick wins, etc.  
  - SWOT Analysis - for listing out the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and figuring out how all of that applies to the given initiative  
  - Continual Improvement Registry (CIR) - Database or structured document to track and manage improvement ideas from identification trough to final action.  
  
  
- **What is Continual Improvement Registry (CRI)?**  
  Database or structured document to track and manage improvement ideas from identification trough to final action.  
  For example, Google sheets with three columns: Improvement idea, Result/Impact/Priority (e.g. High/Medium/Low), Plan of action (e.g. Q1, 2019).  
  
  
- **How continual improvement works in regards of relationships involved**  
  - Leaders - How do we embed continual improvement into the way people think and work by providing that proper vision.  
  - Continual Improvement Team lead by Continual Improvement Manager - How do we lead the continual improvement efforts within the organization and advocate people for the continual improvement practices across the entire organization?  
  - Everyone in the organization - How can we motivate people inside the organization to continually improve? Continual improvement is nota job of continual improvement manager only, it is a job of everyone within the organization.  
  - Partners and Suppliers - How can we improve our relationships with partners and suppliers? E.g. contracts, measurements, reports, etc.  
  
  It closely relates to Continual improvement model and the model steps-related questions:  
  - Leaders: "What is the vision?" (business vision, mission, goals and objectives)  
  - Continual Improvement Team: "Where are we now?" (perform baseline assessments), "Where do we want to be?" (define measurable targets), "How do we get there?" (define the improvement plan)  
  - Everyone in the organization: "Take action" (execute improvement actions)  
  - Partners and Suppliers: "Take action" (execute improvement actions)  
  Then:  
  - "Did we get there?"  
  - "How do we keep the momentum going?"  
  
  
- **How does Continual Improvement practice integrates with Value Chain Activities?**  
  - Plan - Apply the practice to all planning activities, methods, techniques.  
  - Improve - This practice is key to this value chain activity.  
  - All value chain activities (Engage - Design & transition / Obtain/build / Deliver & Support -> Products & Services, including Plan activity and Continual improvement activity itself) are subject to **continual improvement**.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Information Security Management" practice?**  
  To protect the information needed by the organization to conduct its business.  
  It is all about managing the risks of information systems to:  
  - Confidentiality -- it is more and more about cybersecurity nowadays. E.g. encrypting data so nobody can read it except us   
  - Integrity -- make sure data does not change in transit, in use, in storage. E.g. hashing  
  - Availability -- making sure customer has access to the data when and where needed. E.g. redundant highly available systems, e.g. redundant internet connection lines, switches, etc.  
  - Authentication -- making sure you are who you say you are when you are requesting access to the information. E.g. username+password, biometric fingerprint, one more biometric - face recognition, few factor authentication (e.g. username+password and code send to phone; which is "something you know" and "something you have" case)  
  - Non-repudiation -- making sure you are who you say you are and you cannot say you didn't do what you did. E.g. digital signature of email.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Relationship Management" practice?**  
  Establishes and nurtures the links between the organization and its stakeholders at strategic and tactical levels.  
  We do this by identifying, analysing, monitoring, and doing continual improvement of those relationships between various stakeholders.  
  The most common relationship: Service Provider co-create Value together with Service Consumer.  
  Other examples of stakeholders: somebody who asks for a new product/service,  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Supplier Management" practice?**  
  Ensures the organization's suppliers and their performance are managed appropriately to support the provision of seamless and quality products, services, and components.  
  We wish to uncover new values and reduce the risks of failure.  
  Good relationships with **suppliers** can provide you with advanced warning.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management" practice?**  
  Provides an understanding of all the different elements that make up an organization and how those elements interrelate, enabling the organization to effectively achieve its current and future objectives.  
  This provides organization with the principles, the standards, and the tools that enables us to manage complex changes in a more structured and agile way. There are 5 types of architectures inside a business:  
  - Business  
  - Service  
  - Information Systems  
  - Technology  
  - Environmental  
   
   
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management: Business Architecture"?**  
  Allows the organization to look at its capabilities to determine how they align with the different activities that are required for the business to co-create value for its customers.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management: Service Architecture"?**  
  Gives the organization a view of its services and their interactions to be better understand how they all tie together.  
  It is usually results to Service Model being created.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management: Information Systems Architecture"?**  
  Focused on the logical and physical data assets of the organization, and how they are managed and shared to benefit the organization.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management: Technology Architecture"?**  
  Defines the software and hardware infrastructure needed to support the portfolio of services and products that the organization offers.  
  Foe example, self-hosting or cloud-hosting?  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Architecture Management: Environmental Architecture"?**  
  Used to describe the external factors affecting and impacting the organization.  
  For example, factors of PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Knowledge Management" practice?**  
  Practice of providing an understanding of all the different elements that make up an organization and how those elements relate to one another.  
  There are 4 things we look at:  
  - Data  
  - Information ("How do we take data and turn it into information?")  
  - Knowledge ("How do we take information and turn it into knowledge?")  
  - Wisdom ("How do we take knowledge and turn it into wisdom?")  
  For example:  
  - 90  
  - 90 degrees outside  
  - I will put shorts today, it will be hot  
  - Forward looking decision: There may be large amount of users skipping office desk and going to work remotely from the near-by-beach working environment therefore wifi network traffic in that area may increase.     
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Measurement and Reporting" practice?**  
  Practice of supporting good decision-making and continual improvement by decreasing levels of uncertainty.  
  Important measurements:  
  - “What things are you measuring, is it a right things?”  
  - Output vs. Outcome measurements. You should definitely and always measure outcomes, sometimes outputs  
  - Key Performance Indicators  
  - Critical Success Factors  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Organizational Change Management" practice?**  
  Ensures that changes in an organization are smoothly and successfully implemented, and that lasting benefits are achieved by managing the human aspects of change.  
  E.g. changing a culture, acceptance of the culture within the organization, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Portfolio Management" practice?**  
  Ensuring that an organization has the right mix of programs, projects, products, and services to execute its strategy within its funding and resource constraints.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Project Management" practice?**  
  Ensuring that all an organization's projects are successfully delivered.  
  E.g. PRINCE2 (popular in Europe, Asia), PMP (popular in North America)  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Risk Management" practice?**  
  Ensuring that an organization understands and effectively handles risks.  
  It is about identifying all the risks that exists under our products and services, projects we deploy.  
  We can do 4 things with the known risks:  
  - Avoid - eliminate the risk  
  - Mitigate - lower the risk  
  - Transfer - insure the risk  
  - Accept - live with the risk  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Service Financial Management" practice?**  
  Supports the organization's strategies and plans for service management by ensuring that the organization's financial resources and investments are being used effectively.  
  E.g. Return on Investment (ROI)  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Strategy Management" practice?**  
  Formulates the goals of an organization and adopts the courses of action and allocation of resources necessary for achieving those goals.  
  Establishing organizations direction, focusing on effort, finding and clarifying organizational priorities, consistency and guidance to the environment following the same known vision.  
  This will most likely come from C-type of seat, e.g. CEO, CTO, etc.  
  It is being able to see what the future is and turning the organization before that future hits.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of "Workforce and Talent Management" practice?**  
  Ensuring that an organization has the right people with the appropriate skills and knowledge and in the correct roles to support its business objectives.  
  This covers:  
  - Successfully engaging with organization employees  
  - People-based resources / how to extract resources out of people  
  - How to plan for people  
  - How to recruit  
  - How to onboard new people  
  - Help people in learning and development  
  - Ensuring the proper performance measurement of people  
  - Succession planning  
  - Etc.  
  Explore Human Resources (HR) field for more info.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of service management practice called "Change control" (may also be known as "Change management")?**  
  Maximizes the number of successful IT changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing the change schedule.  
  This is a balancing act with "Beneficial effects of changes" on one side and "Adverse effects of changes" on another one.  
  Any time the change is introduced, the new risk is introduced.  
  Each organization define the **scope** of its change control.  For example, by governance, procedures, etc.  
  It all includes:  
  - IT infrastructure  
  - Applications  
  - Documentation  
  - Processes  
  - Supplier relationships  
  - anything else that may directly or indirectly affect the product or service we are about to change  
  
  
- **What is a Change?**  
  Addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on IT services.  
  
  
- **How many types of changes are?**  
  3 types:  
  - Standard:  
    Low-risk and well-understood. Something we do on our own all the time, e.g. service desk answering the call.  
  - Normal:  
    Requires some level of authorization via Change Authority. Planned and scheduled in advance, e.g. upgrading server OS.  
  - Emergency:  
    Have an expedited assessment and authorization process, may have different authority than Normal change authority. Example: server broke apart.  
  
  
- **What is Change Authority?**  
  A person or group responsible for authorizing a change.  
  In some (usually smaller) organizations change authorities are decentralized (we may have many of them, e.g. developer confirming the change of another developer).  
  In some (usually larger) organizations change authorities are centralized.  
  
  
- **Where does the change go after Change authority approves the change?**  
  The change goes to change schedule then.  
  
  
- **What is "Change schedule" used for?**  
  It is used to help plan changes, assist in communication, avoid conflicts, and assign resources.  
  
  
- **What is an Emergency Change?**  
  A change that must be introduced as soon as possible.  
  
  
- **Is failure to plan an emergency change?**  
  Failure to plan is **not** an emergency change.  
  Just because somebody needs the change to be done today does not mean it is an emergency, maybe they just forgot to plan.  
  
  
- **What Value Chain Activities does the "Change control" from Service Management Practices affect?**  
  - Plan - changes to product and service portfolios, policies, and practices must be planned.  
  - Engage - inform customers and users about the nature and schedule of the change.  
  - Design & Transition - changes are designed, approved, and then passed to transition.  
  - Obtain & Build - changes involve purchasing or building new hardware and software (this, when ready, will be the input to Change Control practice).  
  - Deliver & Support - deliver and support is heavily impacted by a change.  
  - Improve - most improvement initiatives require a change to the baseline configuration of your services.  
  
   
- **What is the purpose of service management practice called "Incident Management"?**  
  Minimizes the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.  
  In short: "What are we going to do when something goes wrong?"  
  
  
- **What Value Chain Activities does the "Incident Management" from Service Management Practices affect?**  
  - Plan - ???  
  - Engage - incidents are visible to your users and your customers.  
  - Design & Transition - incident management is conducted even during design & transition activity.  
  - Obtain & Build - incidents can also occur in development environments.  
  - Deliver & Support - incident management is a key practice that occurs during support.  
  - Improve - incident records are a key input into the improvement activities.  
  
  
- **What is an Incident?**  
  An unplanned interruption to a service, or reduction in the quality of service.  
  
  Every incident needs to be:  
  - logged,  
  - managed to the agreed-upon target resolution times,  
  - prioritized.  
  
  We should have a tool-system we will use for the following:  
  - Logging incidents  
  - Managing incidents to the agreed-upon target resolution times  
  - Prioritizing incidents, escalating "What makes an incident a priority?" answer  
  - Identifying incidents  
  - Categorizing, e.g. information security / management / operations / etc.  
  - Classification, e.g. low/mid/high, or 1 to 5, or other.  
  - Resolving procedure  
  - Help and abilities on matching to other incidents, problems, or known errors  
  - Escalation to higher level of support. E.g. Help desk > Tier2 support > Tier3 > etc.  
  - Collect quality and timely updates from people working on the incident to share info with teams, partners, customers, etc.  
  - Self-help tool for users  
  - Contact service desk  
  - Contact support team  
  - Contact suppliers or partners  
  - Management of temporary cross-functional teams to address a specific incident  
  - Contact disaster recovery team  
  
  Incidents prioritization may be based on agreed classification. Everyone (customer, supplier, etc.) should know what that classification is, including answering the question "What makes an incident a priority?".  
  
  Make sure incidents with highest business impact are resolved first.  
  
  Solving incidents relies heavily on collaboration and information sharing.  
  
  
- **What is Swarming?**  
  Involves many different stakeholders working together initially, until it becomes very clear which of them is best placed to continue and who can mode on to other tasks.  
  For example, this may be the case if a major incident, like a serious cyberattack, happened.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of service management practice called "Problem Management"?**  
  Reduces the likelihood and impact of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents, and managing workarounds and known errors.  
  
  Problem management heavily relies on other practices in form of outputs and inputs to other practices:  
  - Incident Management  
  - Risk Management  
  - Change Control  
  - Knowledge Management  
  - Continual Improvement  
  
  Value chain activities are heavily affected as well:  
  - Plan - ???  
  - Engage - Problems are visible to your users and your customers  
  - Design & Transition - Problem management provides information to help improve testing and knowledge transfer  
  - Obtain & Build - Problem management can help identify and manage product defects  
  - Deliver & Support - Problem management is a key practice that occurs during support  
  - Improve - Provides an understanding of how to reduce incidents and their impacts  
  
  
- **What is a Problem?**  
  A cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents.  
  
  
- **How incident becomes a problem?**  
  ?Incident becomes a problem when incident happens more than once.  
  Sometimes a problem may be classified as an known error.  
  
  Incident - an unplanned interruption to a service, or reduction in the quality of service.  
  Problem - a cause, or potential cause, of one or more incidents.  
  Known error - a problem that has been analyzed and has not been resolved.  
  
  
- **What is Known error?**  
  A problem that has been analyzed and has not been resolved.  
  
  
- **What is a Workaround?**  
  A solution that reduces or eliminates the impact of an incident or problem for which a full resolution is not yet available.  
  
  Workarounds can be created at any stage. Workaround may be done before the problem analysis is fully completed, it is ok.  
  
  
- **What are the 3 major steps inside of Problem management?**  
  1. Problem Identification (examples: trend analysis, identifying what recurring incidents or major incidents have happened, we are looking at all the supplier and partner information, the software developers, testers, and projects that are going-on and identifying issues that may turn into problems for us.)  
  2. Problem Control - prioritizing, managing based on the risks, analyze from the perspective of all four dimensions of service management (what can solve this problem? Organizations and people, Information and technology, Partners and suppliers, Value streams and processes ?).  
  3. Error Control - identifying potential permanent solutions for the problem, reassessing status of known errors and workarounds, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of service management practice called "Service Desk"?**  
  Capture demand for incident resolution and service requests.  
  This is an entry point or single point contact for a service provider for all of its users.  
  
  
- **What are the steps Service desk takes?**  
  - Receive everything: an issue request, a change request, request for service, an incident, etc.  
  - Acknowledge  
  - Classify  
  - Own  
  - Act  
  
  Service desk was created as an entry point for technical support matters. However, it evolved to "we help you all with anything, including technical issues" during the time.  
  Service desk has a major influence on user experience.  
  Service desk is gates between service provider and users.  
  Service desk focuses on excellent **customer service**, therefore soft skills are very important.  
  Support and development teams need to work in close **collaboration** with the service desk. For example, user calls to service desk to know the status of the ticket, not directly to technicians.  
  
  That's how users access service desk, for example:  
  - Phone calls  
  - Service portals  
  - Live chat (real person)  
  - Chatbot (robots)  
  - Email  
  - Walk-in service  
  - Text messages  
  - Social media  
  - Discussion boards  
  - etc.  
  
  Some technologies used by service desk:  
  - Intelligent telephony systems  
  - Workflow systems  
  - Workflow management  
  - Resource planning systems  
  - Knowledge base  
  - Call recording and quality control  
  - Remote access tools  
  - Dashboard and monitoring tools  
  - Configuration management systems  
  - etc.  
  
  Couple of skills the new service desk employee should possess with:  
  - Excellent customer service skills  
  - Empathy  
  - Emotional intelligence  
  - Understand business priority  
  - Incident analysis and prioritization  
  - Effective communication  
  - etc.  
  
  
- **What are the types of Service Desks?**  
  - Local - located within or close to the users that it serves (often very expensive, inefficient)  
  - Centralized - single location to serve all users (quite efficient, cost effective, some problems cannot be fixed if user is not near by)  
  - Virtual - allows agents to work from multiple, geographically-dispersed locations  
  - Follow the sun - combination of service desk types (local/centralized/virtual) working in different time zones during daytime to allow 24x7 support  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Virtual Service Desk?**  
  Allows agents to work from multiple, geographically-dispersed locations.  
  
  
- **How Support Desk practice integrates with Service Value Chain activities?**  
  - Plan - ???  
  - Engage - main channel for engagement with users  
  - Design & Transition - service desk provides a channel to communicate with users about new and changed services, service desk personal can participate in release planning, testing, early live support  
  - Obtain & Build - service desk **acquires** service components to fulfill service requests and resolve incidents, e.g. maybe the hard drive crashed and then service desk personal orders it  
  - Deliver & Support - service desk is the central coordination point  
  - Improve - monitors and evaluates support for continual improvement  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Level Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Sets clear business-based targets for service performance so that the delivery of a service can be properly assessed, monitored, and managed against these targets.  
  
  Provides end-to-end visibility of services by establishing a shared view of service and a target service levels with the customers so both the customers and we know what to expect.  
  Is responsible for collecting, storing, reporting relevant metrics to ensure that we are meeting the service levels.  
  Performing service level reviews to ensure the current services meets the needs of organization and the customer.  
  Captures and reports on service issues including performance against defined service levels. For example, if we declare to customers we have 99.99 % availability then service level management will measure if meet this criteria.  
   
  
- **What is Service Level Agreement (SLA)?**  
  Documented agreement between a service provider and a customer that identifies services required and the expected level of service.  
  SLA - tool that is being used to measure the performance from the **customer's** point of view.  
  
  Successful SLA:  
  - Related to a defined service (e.g. Not "customer is happy". The outcome should be measurable, e.g. "customer should have the email in 5 seconds" or "..in 5 minutes", - what is "happy"? what is "fast"? etc.)  
  - Agreement is between the service provider and service consumer, they both understand and have a common baseline on the topics like "fast enough", "happy enough", etc.  
  - Must be simply written and easy to understand by all parties, may not be in "legal jargon"  
  
  When we write SLA, we focus on:  
  - Relationship management  
  - Supplier management  
  - Skills and competences  
  - Business liaison  
  - Business analyst  
  This will contain who is responsible for what, and at what level  
  
  Sources:  
  - SLA (customer engagement and agreement we have)  
  - Initial listing  
  - Discovery and information capture  
  - Measurement and ongoing process discussions  
  - Asking simple open-ended questions  
  - Customer feedback! (survey, business related measurements and metrics)  
  - Operational metrics (server uptime, capacity, etc.)  
  - Business metrics (monthly recurring revenue, lifetime value of a customer, Average Revenue Per Account, Months to Recover CAC, Churn, etc.)  
  
  
- **How Service Level Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices integrates with Service Value Chain activities?**  
  - Plan - supports planning of product and service portfolio and service offerings  
  - Engage - ensures ongoing engagement with customers and users through feedback  
  - Design & Transition - Service Level Management provides an input into the design of new and changed services (e.g. "email should be sent in 5 seconds")   
  - Obtain & Build - obtain and build activity receives objectives for components and service performance  
  - Deliver & Support - communicates service performance objectives to the operations and support teams  
  - Improve - Service level management is a driving force for continual service improvement  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Request Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Supports the agreed quality of a service by handling all predefined, user-initiated service requests in an effective and user-friendly manner.  
  For example: "lets create the new email distribution", "I need headset attached to my computer at work", "I want 27-inch monitor instead of what I have now", "I need more share drive space", "I need bigger email account", "I need another email address", "I need my account unlocked", etc.  
  
  Service Request Management works in 3 steps:  
  - Initiate  
  - Approve  
  - Fulfill  
  
  Service requests are a **normal** part of service delivery, it is not an emergency management via incident management-alike practice.  
  
  
- **What is Service Request?**  
  A request from a user or user's authorized representative that initiates a service action that has been agreed as a normal part of service delivery.  
  Service request management should use automation to the greatest degree possible when dealing with service requests.  
  
  These are requests for low risk and well understood changes, we should not waste human hours on it (lets focus on incident management instead!). For example a regular service request for:  
  - Service delivery action (e.g. get a new computer for the new employee)  
  - Information  
  - Provision of a resource (e.g. give me 16 GB instead of 4 GB)  
  - Access to a resource (e.g. I need access to the company's shared drive)  
  - Feedback  
  
  Few other notes:  
  - Seek out opportunities for improvement.    
  - Create appropriate **policies** to limit, remove, and minimize the need for additional approvals  
  - Deliver on your promise (e.g. do not state "Deliver in 5 minutes", rather use "deliver in 5 minutes if the item is in stock")  
  - Redirect incidents and problems to the appropriate practices  
  - Make sure the approval part is considered  
  - Make a workflow for one or another type of requests  
  - Optimize workflow **then** automate  
  - Manage expectations  
  - Use self-service wherever it is possible, e.g. "password reset", etc.  
  - Leverage **existing** workflow models, you most often don't need to start from the scratch  
  
  
- **How Service Request Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices integrates with Service Value Chain activities?**  
  - Plan - ???  
  - Engage - provides regular communications to help set expectations, makes it clear for users to understand the requirements, the expectations, and the status  
  - Design & Transition - **standard changes are** used to initiate and fulfill service requests  
  - Obtain & Build - obtain/build fulfills service requests through the acquisition of pre-approved components  
  - Deliver & Support - service request management makes a significant contribution to **normal** service delivery    
  - Improve - provides users a channel for improvement initiatives, compliments, and complaints  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of IT Asset Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  To plan and manage the full lifecycle of all IT assets, to help the organization:  
  1. Maximize value  
  2. Control costs  
  3. Manage risks  
  4. Support decision-making about purchase, re-use, and retirement of assets  
  5. Meet regulatory and contractual requirements  
  
  It is basically about the inventory: what we know about it, tracking the lifecycle of it, budgeting and replacing on time, etc.  
  IT Asset Management helps on all steps: purchase, use, retirement, replacement.  
  
  
- **What is IT asset?**  
  Any valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT product or service.  
  For example, mobile phones, servers, network gear, switches, laptops, monitors, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Monitoring and Event Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Systematically observes a service or service component, and record and report selected changes of state identified as events  
  
  This practice identifies and prioritizes:  
  - Infrastructure  
  - Services  
  - Business processes  
  - Information security events  
  And establishes the proper response to those events, including responding to the conditions that could lead to potential faults or incidents.  
  
  
- **What is an Event?**  
  Any **change of state that has significance** for the management of a configuration item (CI) or IT service.  
  
  For example, you login successfully, failed to login successfully, bandwidth exceeded, free space on the server got below a certain threshold, etc.  
  We want to be sure we take some action on these events. It may be jus an informational event (e.g. user logged in, we know it, its ok, nothing to do), but it also may be a warning (e.g. login failure that happened 3 times, we may want to know why), an alert (e.g. free space on production server is less than 10 GB), or other.  
  
  Some events will be **referred** to a problem or incident management.  
  
 
- **What is the purpose of Release Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  To make new and changed services and features available for use.  
  
  It is about managing:  
  Release plan > (New or changed infrastructure / New or changed software / Training and documentation) > (Deploy and release / Deploy and release / Deploy and release | OR | Deploy and release ) > Review  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Configuration Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures that accurate and reliable information about the configuration of services, and configuration items that support them, is available when and where it is needed.  
  
  
- **What is Configuration Item?**  
  Any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service.  
  For example, a server, as switch, a laptop, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Availability Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures services deliver agreed levels of availability to meet the needs of customers and users.  
  
  Availability here means ability of an IT service or other configuration item to perform its agreed-upon function when it's required.  
  For example: when we follow a web address, we want the web to come up, e.g. we agree it will come up 99.999% (entire year minus 5 minutes) of the times.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Business Analysis practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Analyzing a business, or some element of that business, to define its needs and recommend solutions to address those needs, or to solve a business problem.  
  
  When we think about business analysis, we think about it outside of IT world. Normally, we are thinking about "dollars and cents" here, IT world falls into lower domain here.  
  For example: "How can I solve some sort of business problem with anything I have (IT, marketing, etc.)"  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Capacity and Performance Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures services achieve agreed-upon and expected performance, satisfying current and future demand in a cost-effective way.  
  
  
- **What is Performance?**  
  Measure of what is achieved by delivering a system, person, team, practice, or service.  
  
  Service performance - associated with the number of service actions performed in a timeframe, and and the time required to fulfill a service action at a given level of demand.   
  For example, "When you have the item ordered via e-store, the digital item arrives to your mailbox in 5 minutes"  
  
  
- **What is Service Capacity?**  
  Maximum throughput that configuration item or service can deliver.  
  For example, capacity of the hard rive - how much data we can store on it in GB? capacity of a network connection - how fast it may be in Mbps?, etc.  
  
  A lot of metrics come into play here, just remember to measure the outcomes, not just outputs!  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Catalog Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Provides a single source of consistent information on all services and service offerings, and ensures that it is available to the relevant audience.  
  
  The main point here is to tell people what services are coming, what is being taken away, and what is currently available.  
  
  For example, some web-based businesses list all the services and offerings they have to their home page.  
  Another example, IT company may have different service components for mobile, desktop, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Continuity Management practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures that the availability and performance of a service is maintained at a sufficient level in the event of a disaster.  
  
  
- **What is Disaster?**  
  Sudden, unplanned event that causes great damage or serious loss to an organization.  
  For example, natural disaster like hurricane, or technology-based like hacker or a data breach.  
  
  This practice will provide with the framework for building organization's resiliency and ensure that you have the capability of producing the effective responses needed to safeguard the interests of your key stakeholders and your organization's reputation, your brand and your value creating activities.  
  For example, multiple copies of the server backups online and offline, redundant servers, load balancer, etc.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Design practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Practice of designing products and services that are fit for purpose, fit for use, and that can be delivered by the organization and its ecosystem.  
  
  "Fit for purpose" = Utility  
  "Fit for use" =  Warranty  
  "Delivered by the organization and its ecosystem" = Capabilities  
  
  For example, if we develop services on a cloud, we don't want to limit our services by the means of stand-alone servers, we design services around different means here.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Validation and Testing practice of Service management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures that new or changed products and services meet defined requirements.  
  
  For example, if we run the website and introduce new service, we may running some beta testing in-house, with external testers, etc.  
  Before we transition services into live environment, we want them to be validated, tested.  
  When all is moved to a production web environment, we run the validation and testing once again to make sure all operates as designed.  
  
  
- **What are practices in Technical Management Practices group about?**  
  Adapted from technology management domains for service management purposes by expanding or shifting their focus from technology solutions to IT services.  
  In ITIL4 there are only 3 technical management practices:  
  - Deployment Management  
  - Infrastructure and Platform Management  
  - Software Development and Management  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Deployment Management practice of Technical management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  To move new or changed hardware, software, documentation, processes, or any other component to live environments.  
  
  It may also be involved with the components deploying to other environments for testing and staging.  
  Basically, we used to have release and deployment as one processes but in ITIL4 it is separated practices:  
  Release - focused on approval process  
  Deployment - focused on moving the change over into the live environment.  
  
  When we build new feature, it will go through approval, release management process, and eventually it will be deployed through Deployment Management and move itself from Transition into Deliver and Support perspective.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Infrastructure and Platform Management practice of Technical management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Oversees the infrastructure and platforms used by an organization.  
  
  In other words, this is going to enable the monitoring of the technology solutions that are available, including solutions from third-parties.  
  For example, the servers, the network, all of that.  
  People monitoring all of it is part of infrastructure and platform management.  
  This tend to be a very technical domain, and it is one that is covered by technical personnel who are responsible to make sure the systems are up-and-running at all times.  
  Normally, these are people in the network operations center, security operations center.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Software Development and Management practice of Technical management group of ITIL4 practices?**  
  Ensures that applications meet internal and external stakeholder needs, in terms of functionality, reliability, maintainability, compliance, and auditability.  
  
  For example, if I want to install Windows Server 2019 the Software Development an Management assure that the application satisfies functionality, reliability, maintainability, compliance, and auditability requirements. Software Development an Management will not push the change into release (it's for Deployment management) but will track the information in order to assure it meets the requirements.
