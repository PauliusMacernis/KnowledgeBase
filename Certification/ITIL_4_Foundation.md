- **What are the industrial revolutions, when it has happened, what each of it has to do with ITIL?**  
  1st industrial revolution. Around 18-19 centuries. Humanity moved from agrarian-based farmer societies into urbanized industrial area. Mechanization (iron, textile), steam (e.g. steam engines) and water power. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  2nd industrial revolution. Around WWI (1st WWorld War) we moved to mass production and electricity. For example, steal, oil, electricity, electric-powered equipment, cars with internal combustion engines, light bulb light replace candle light, communication across long distance became possible through the use of a telephone, etc. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  3rd industrial revolution (digital revolution). Around 1980s-1990s. Electronic and IT systems, automation. ITIL was starting in this period of time. ITIL ment Information Technology Infrastructure Library back then. (the name became not valid after ITILv4 release)  
  4th industrial revolution. Around early 21st century. It is happening now. Cyber physical systems in where we loose boundaries between physical and digital. For example: robotics, nano technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, autonomous cars,etc. ITIL4 is not an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, it is ITIL (just a brand name) for 4th industrial revolution. ITIL is for the entire service now.   
  
  
- **What is Service Organization?**    
  !!!THIS IS MY OWN ANSWER TAKEN FROM THE CONTEXT OF ITILv4 STUDY MATERIAL. THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. HOWEVER, I DO THINK IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR THE ITILv4 FOUNDATION CASE.!!!    
  It is an organization that is involved in services by any means.  
  Actually, Service management goes beyond services these days, we may probably call services "something".  
  
  
- **What is Service Management?**    
  A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling **value** to customers in the form of **services**.    
  ITIL 4 provides organizations with a comprehensive framework for IT service management.   
  
  
- **What is Governance?**  
  The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.  
  Each organization has a different process, for example to direct and control vacation requests of employees. The way an organization runs things is known as governance.    
  
  
 <!-- Service Management -->
  
  
- **What Organizational capability refers to in ITIL4?**  
  Organizational capability refers to having both the **capacity** and the **ability** to perform the functions required.  
  
  
- **What should organization do in order to perform the functions required?**    
  **Organize** people to best support the activities, practices, and processes. (None of these activities, practices, and processes could be done in isolation. Instead, organization should go through service management process.)    
  
  
- **What is Value?**  
  The **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.   
  
  
- **Who determines the perceived value?**  
  The recipient determines the perceived value.   
  Value is based on **recipient's** perception.  
  The example of orange:   
  1st case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten, peel (0% value) is thrown away. Total value - 100%   
  2nd case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (0% value) is thrown away, peel (100% value) is used for the cake. Total value - 100%  
  3rd case: Orange got by two people, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten by one person, peel (100% value) is used for the cake by another person. Total value - 200%    
  
  
- **Who creates the value?**   
  Value is **co-created** by the service provider and the consumer. Example certification course online - service provider should input the course, service consumer should take the course and successfully pass the exam after.  
  Value is **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.  
  Value perceived is determined by the recipient.    
  
  
- **What is Organization?**    
  A person or a group of people that has its own functions, responsibilities, and relationships to achieve its objectives.  
  Organizations vary in size, complexity, and in their legal structure.  
  
  
- **What are two basic roles an ORGANIZATION can fulfill?**   
  1. Service Provider (supplier)  
  2. Consumer  
  Service Provider (supplier) AND Consumer may be simultaneous (e.g. providing services, having partners to manage, buying materials from somewhere, etc.).  
  
  
- **What are three basic roles PEOPLE can fulfill?**   
  User  
  Customer  
  Sponsor  
  All these basic roles people in organization may fulfill (user, customer, sponsor) may by fulfilled by the same person (e.g. buying a new car to myself) or several people (e.g. buying the new car for own child/user when mom/customer is picking the car and dad/sponsor is giving money for it).  
  
  
- **May a disconnect between requirements, budget, and usability occur?**  
  Yes. A disconnect between requirements (customer), budget (sponsor), and usability (user) may occur. This kind of disconnection may cause problems because sponsor who funds the requirements and customer who creates these requirements often have arguments over what those requirement should be.      
  
  
- **What is Service Provider?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a service relationship to provide services to consumers.  
  
  
- **What is Consumer?**  
  A role performed by an organization in a relationship that uses (or consumes) those services.   
  
  
- **By which means organizations are bound together?**  
  Organizations are bound together by common objectives, relationships, and authorities.  
  People are **organized** around common goals *within* a larger business organization to achieve common objectives in a coordinated method.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: User?**  
  A person who uses services.  
  User ~ usability.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: Customer?**  
  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.   
  Customer ~ requirements.   
  
  
- **What is a role of: Sponsor?**    
  A person who authorizes the budget for service consumption.   
  Sponsor ~ budget (also:, efficiency, cost savings).  
  
  
- **What is our responsibility as a Service provider in regards of three basic user roles within the company?**    
  It is our responsibility to recognize these three generic roles on a consumer side, and work with them appropriately.    
  
  
- **What is Service?**  
  **Means of enabling value co-creation** by **facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve**, **without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks**.  
  Services may be based on products.  
  
  
- **What is the whole reason Consumer (customer) hires Service provider?**    
  Costs and risks passed to Service provider refers to the whole reason why a consumer (a customer) hires a service provider in the first place.  
  
  
- **Can service provider achieve outcomes for a consumer?**  
  A service provider **cannot** achieve outcomes for a consumer. Consumer has to achieve outcomes by their self.  
  Service provider is only able to facilitate the achievement of those customer outcomes.  
  For example, service provider may ensure the server is up and able to run the e-shop but if consumer do not provide necessary input steps then achieving desired outputs and eventually the outcomes are not possible.  
  
  
- **May services be based on products?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **What is Product?**  
  Configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for its customers.    
  Resources can be owned or managed by organization. Resources could be leased, or rented, could even be people working in organization, etc.    
  We may also think about it as a collection of services put together that provides more value together than they could individually.   
  A **product** is how an organization configures resources into an offer. For example, AWS has many service offerings but if you add these products into a set then it may become a product, e.g. Amazon lightsail.    
  A product **combines** and simplifies the various services.    
  
  
- **What is Service Offering**  
  A description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  
  
- **What can include Service offerings?**  
  Service offering can include:    
  Goods  
  Access to resources    
  Service actions   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Service, Product and Service offering?**    
  Terms:   
  Service - a description of one or more services deigned to address the needs of a target consumer group.  
  Product - "a configuration of an organization’s resources designed to offer value for a consumer."    
  Service offering - "a description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources, and service actions."    
  *My answer ("Close, but not quite right..."):*   
  Service - the smallest entity in the set of Service, Product, Service offering.    
  Product - a set of Services.   
  Service offering - a description of Service or Product.  
  *Jason's answer (The right answer):*  
  Service - think of it as something to provide for a need (like water service to your home). For example, internet service for your laptop.  
  Product - think of this as a "Thing". Something tanigible that you can touch. Your laptop is a product.  
  Service offering - a grouping of products and services offered to the customer (Maybe a laptop with a 4g cellular card and 2 years of free internet included, as an example).  
  
  
- **What are Goods?**  
  Things that are transferred from the Service provider to the Consumer, and then the Consumer is responsible for their future use.  
  For example: a phone from a service provider.   
  
  
- **What is Access to Resources?**  
  Access to resources are granted or licensed to a consumer under agreed terms and conditions.    
  For example: a paid membership on the website.  
  
  
- **What is Service action?**  
  Actions performed to address a consumer's needs.  
  For example: an additional support on using a web platform.  
  
    
- **What is Service Relationship?**  
  A cooperation between a Service provider and Service consumer including service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.    
  
  
- **What is Service provision?**  
  The activities performed by an organization to provide the services.    
  For example: managing service provider resources, configure them to deliver the services, providing access to the resources to the users, and fulfilling the agreed upon servuce actions, conducting service level management, performing continual improvement to the services, supplying good to the consumers, etc.    
  
    
- **Give at least one example of Account provisioning**    
  When phone service provider activates your account (sim card, phone number, etc.) after you purchase it.    
  
  
- **What is Service consumption?**  
  The activities performed by an organization (which may also be a single person) to consume the services.      
  Service consumption includes: management of consumer's resources that are needed to use the service (e.g. paying the bill regularly to make sure service stays working), all other actions that consumer performs to utilize the provider's resources (e.g. checking the email, making phone calls on the new phone), requesting new service actions to be fulfilled (e.g. request for data roaming), etc. When consumer is doing something - this is called service consumption.      
  
  
- **Who provides Service provision?**  
  Service provider.  
  
  
- **Who provides Service consumption?**    
  Service consumer.  
  
  
- **Are there any activities in Service relationship management scope provided by both (Service provider and Service consumer)?**    
  Yes, it is Service relationship management.  
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Management?**     
  The activities that the service provider and the service consumer do together to enable value co-creation to occur based upon the service offerings.      
  For example: Consumer pays bill on time so the Service provider has resources to continue providing the service.  
  Another example: Service provider informs Consumer about upcoming service upgrades, shortages, etc.   
  
  
- **What is Service Relationship Model?**  
  !!!May be wrong!!! The model that considers every single service involved in Service relationship. A drawing (a model, a schema) contains every single relationship within the company and it's relationship to related service providers and consumers via Service offerings (Goods, Access to resources, Service actions).  
  For example, the model (e.g. diagram) containing all the relationships:    
  Google cloud provides services to a Video courses streaming platform,  
  Video courses streaming platform provides services to Video courses making company,      
  Video courses making company provides services to Subscribers,  
  Google has employees that are Subscribers.  
  
  
- **May organization be both a service provider and service consumer at the same time?**    
  Yes, it can be both at the same time.  
  It may be one at the time as well.  
 
  
- **What is Outcome?**  
  A result for a stakeholder, enabled by one or more outputs.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  


- **What is Outcome focused on: Service provider' desired outcome or Consumer's desired outcome?**  
  Consumer's desired outcome.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Affected outcomes or Supported outcomes?**  
  Supported outcomes.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Costs introduced or Costs removed?**  
  Costs removed.  
  
  
- **Which is better in terms of Value co-creation: Risks removed or Risks introduced?**   
  Risks removed.  
  
  
- **What are the three main components adding increasing Value?**  
  Supported outcomes, Costs removed, Risks removed.   
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What are the three main components decreasing Value?**    
  Affected outcomes, Costs introduced, Risks introduced.  
  For example: Using "Uber" while traveling within big city VS. Renting a car when traveling to remote places. Both creates different value for the person depending on the situation. When the value proposition is **good**, a business agreement can be made. Value propositions **change** when the factors change.    
  
  
- **What is Output?**    
  A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.    
  For example: a report, a bill at the end of the month, email, etc.   
  
  
- **What is the difference between Outcome and Output?**  
  Services facilitate outcomes **through** one or more outputs.    
  For example, video making company produces a video (output). The desired value video is targeted to achieve by the video is the outcome. So in this case, viewer passing the exam after watching the video may be the outcome here.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.  
  Outcomes achieve **results**.      
  Output is part of the outcome.   
  
  
- **Should you care more about the outcome or an the output?**    
  You should care more about the **outcome** than the output.  
  By the way, outputs are quite easily measurable while the outcomes are not that easy.    
  Outcomes achieve **results**.  
  
  
- **What metrics should be defined: of Outcome or of Output?**    
  Both. Define metrics that measure outcomes and not just outputs.    
  If you will focus on output-only metrics then you may achieve output-related target but you may fail on achieving outcomes. Which may result to the entire business going down.    
  
  
- **What is Cost?**    
  The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource.   
  Cost may be measured financially, also in man-hours, full-time equivalents (FTEs), etc.  
  
  
- **What is FTE?**  
  Full-time equivalent (FTE) or whole time equivalent (WTE) is a unit that indicates the workload of an employed person (or student) in a way that makes workloads or class loads comparable across various contexts. FTE is often used to measure a worker's or student's involvement in a project, or to track cost reductions in an organization. An FTE of 1.0 is equivalent to a full-time worker or student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals half of a full work or school load.    
  One FTE equals 2000 hours of work per year.    
  
  
- **What are aims of Service provider in regards of costs when providing a service for a consumer?**    
  A service provider aims to **reduce or remove** costs for a consumer when providing a service.  
  
  
- **What is Risk?**    
  A possible event that could cause harm, loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.    
  
  
- **What is a service provider's goal in terms of risks when in relationship with a consumer (customer)?**    
  A service provider's goal should be to **reduce** risks for the consumer.  
  
  
- **Is risk potentially imposed on consumers by the service?**  
  Yes. **Risk** is potentially imposed on consumers by the service.    
  
  
- **Who should contribute to the reduction of risk potentially imposed by the service?**    
  Both: Service provider and Consumer.  
  For example, Uber. The service provider (in this case - Uber) has to be sure helpdesk is working well and the consumer should be sure the phone is charged, phone usage is possible, etc.  
  Another example with Uber. If the service of Uber does not work in your location you may communicate with Uber in regards of this inconvenience for you. Uber may then consider the issue and may take actions (or not) in order to improve their service for users like you.  
  It is up to a consumer to clearly communicate the needs to a service provider and clarify the outcomes he/she wants to achieve.  
  
  
- **What are the main points in regards of Consumer's communication to Service provider?**  
  1. Define the requirements of the service and clarify the required outcomes.  
  2. Clearly communicate any constraints and the critical success factors.  
  3. Consumers must ensure providers have access to the necessary resources.  
  
  
- **How can we deal with a Risk?**  
  Avoid  
  Accept  
  Transfer  
  Mitigate  
  
  
- **What is Risk avoidance?**  
  Risk avoidance involves removing risks from the service.    
  For example, ignoring GDPR regulation by not collecting any data mentioned in GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is Risk acceptance?**    
  Risk acceptance is used when the risk or cost is considered low.  
  For example, if you are outside of Europe you may choose to ignore GDPR regulations based on your own assumption that GDPR sanctions are applied heavily to business entities within Europe only.    
  
   
- **What is Risk transfer?**  
  Risk transfer is often used when you insure against a risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR you may want to hire someone else to collect, store and give the access to the data for you. This way the risk is transferred to another party.    
  Another example, in case of GDPR you may decide to buy an insurance and be paid by insurance company in case you get sue. This way the risk is transferred to insurance company.     
  
  
- **What is Risk mitigation?**    
  Risk mitigation is used when you implement technology or processes to reduce the risk.    
  For example, in case of GDPR introduce the new software, hardware, and/or other upgrades helping to meet the requirements introduced with GDPR.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between a desired Outcome and a Requirement?**   
  "Outcome - a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.  
  Requirement - a thing that is needed or wanted; a necessary condition.  
  
  So, these are closely tied together, but they are (not?) the exact same thing. Requirements are set by one side, as you said. For example, if I am hiring you to build a website for me, I get to set the requirements. I may say that the site must provide enough service to support 10k users. That is my requirement.  
  Now, how you go about doing that (will you build it on a Linux or Windows server, what programming language, etc) is up to you as the service provider.  
  We both want the same thing though: "A website that can handled up to 10k users at a time." But, that is really an output, not an outcome.  
  The outcome would be that our end users are happy because the site is properly supporting their needs.  
  When we think of requirements, they are usually tied to "warranty" of a given service. These can add to the outcome when they are met, but they aren't the outcome themselves."    
  
  
- **What is Utility?**  
  Functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.      
  We may think about Utility in terms of "What the service does", "The way it performs", "Allows somebody to accomplish an outcome".  Or simply "Fit for purpose".      
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility.  
  
  
- **What is Warranty?**  
  Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.  
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  We may think about Warranty in terms of "How the service performs". Or simply "Fit for use".    
  For example, the web works - warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - utility.  
  
  
- **What considerations warranty addresses? Give a few examples.**   
  Warranty addresses areas such as availability, capacity, security levels, and continuity.  
  
  
- **Is availability of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is capacity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.   
  
  
- **Is security levels of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time - a warranty.  
  
  
- **Is continuity of a service or a product a subject of a warranty, or more of a utility?**    
  Most of the time -  a warranty.  
  
  
- **What is the difference between Utility and Warranty?**    
  Warranty is "fit for use"/"how the service performs" (for example, the brand new car is very good to drive from point A to point B) while Utility is "fit for purpose"/"what the service does" (but, for example, the car may not have enough space for the bigger family so it is not utility for the family).    
  For example, the server runs on elastic and powerful server - warranty,        
  Another example, car may drive from point A to point B - utility, how many miles per liter, how long the engine stays up, how cold or warm it gets inside, etc. - warranty.  
  
  
- **Which of two (utility, warranty) should a service have?**    
  A service should have both utility and warranty.  
  
  
- **What kind of conditions warranty requires?**  
  Warranty requires that a service has defined and agreed-upon conditions that are met.    
  Warranty requires a service supports the performance or removes constraints from consumers.    
  
  This suggests that a warranty is quite easy measurable. And this is why most of IT people like it.   
  For example, the web works - this functionality may be called warranty. A user may efficiently use the web for his/her purpose - this functionality may be called utility. That's why the service cannot be run successfully without both waranty and utility.    
  
  
- **Could "four dimensions of service management" be called "four perspectives of service management"?**  
  Yes, it could.  
  
  
- **What is in the center of four different dimensions of service management?**  
  The value is in the center. It is the value we want to co-create by using different products and services deliverable by a service provider to a consumer/customer.  
  
  
- **What are the four different dimensions of service management?**  
  - Organizations and people
  - Information and technology
  - Partners and suppliers  
  - Value streams and processes
  
  
- **Name external factors (at least six of them) that impact value co-creation.**  
  - Political factors  
  - Economical factors  
  - Social factors  
  - Technological factors  
  - Legal factors  
  - Environmental factors  


- **What tend to be the difference between horizontal (flat) and vertical organization hierarchies in terms of agility?**  
  - Horizontal structures tend to be more agile  
  - Vertical structures tend to be more process driven  
  
  
- **Which of organizational structures (vertical or horizontal) tend to be more process driven?**  
  - Horizontal structures tend to be more agile  
  - Vertical structures tend to be more process driven  
  
  
- **What is culture (e.g. of organization)?**  
  Culture - shared values and attitudes of the organization.  
    
  
- **Is culture starting at the top and funnels down throughout the company, or is it starting from the bottom?**  
  Culture starts at the top and funnels down throughout the company.  
  
  
- **Name couple of worries in regards of topics related to Organizations and People?**  
  - How will we form our organizational structures to support the services and products we want to deliver?  
  - How do we set an organization?  
    For example:  
      - Formal organization types: sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, multi-level conglomerate, other?  
      - Where it will be based: America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa? What country?     
    
  - How will it gonna function?  
    For example:  
      - Organizational hierarchies (vertical or horizontal/flat?)  
      - How do we break up the company (departments, functions)  
      - Finding right people (HR, then managers and leaders for departments, then more and more right people)  
      - Continual training development of your workforce is important: skills, competences, etc.  
      - Roles and responsibilities (single or multiple hats, etc.)  
    
  - What kind of culture it gonna have?  
    For example:  
      - Values, Mission, Vision  
      - Communication (formal/informal, in person/by email, trust/transparency of the top leader plans, vision share/not, goals share/not, values/mission/vision advocates, etc.)  
      - Individual people (leadership style, somehow different mission, vision. values, etc.)  
  
  - How to take care of people so the people can deliver products and services  
    For example:  
      - Communication with people inside and outside the organization, sharing of knowledge and specializations  
      - How do we facilitate value creation?  
      
  - etc.
  
  
- **What does Technology support?**  
  - IT Service. For example, for Uber that may be the mobile app.  
  - IT Service Management. Technology that supports IT Service Management ensures the business can function properly. For example, intranet.    
  
  Sometimes the technology may be used in both areas.  
  
  
- **Give at least one example of service where information management is the primary means of enabling customer value.**  
  For example, the newspaper that's online - delivering information.  
  Another example, data analytics publishing their results.  
  
  
- **Name at least 6 factors that the information is judged by**    
  - Availability  
  - Reliability  
  - Accessibility  
  - Timeliness  
  - Accuracy  
  - Relevance  
  
  
- **Name at least two challenges information management has.**  
  - Security  
  - Regulatory compliance requirements  
  
  
- **What are the considerations we should be thinking of when looking at Information and Technology?**  
  - Is it compatible with the current **architecture**? Will it gonna work with the technology we are currently using?  
  - Does it raise any regulatory, compliance, or information security control **issues**?  
  - Will it continue to be **viable** in the foreseeable future?  
  - Does it align with the service provider or service consumer **strategy**?  
  - Does the organization have the right **skills** to support and maintain the technology?  
  - Does it have enough **automation** capabilities to be developed, deployed, and operated?  
  - Does it have additional **capabilities** that can be leveraged for other products or services?  
  - Does it introduce new **risks** or **constraints** to the organization?  
  
  
- **May organizational culture have an impact on a risk tolerance?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **Why "Organizations and people" is not the same as "Partners and suppliers" on four dimensions of service management?**  
  "Organizations and people" - internal focus.  
  "Partners and suppliers" - external focus.  
  
  
- **Why "Partners" and "Suppliers" from "Partners and suppliers" on four dimensions of service management are not put into the one single merged term?**  
  "Partners" and "Suppliers" are not the same.  
  Therefore there are two different externally focused strategies: partner strategy, supplier strategy.  
  Partner relationship is about the services that are more critical to the business. We want to be as much involved into partner's evolution-life as possible, we may want to share plans, road maps, etc. We will share common goals and risks with partners, we will collaborate to achieve desired outcomes, we want both brands to be valuable, employers to be happy, etc. Partners are used for critical business functions and in-depth relationships.    
  Suppliers relationship is about the services that are not so critical. E.g. regular tools for office use. Suppliers relationship may be done through formal contracts, clear separation of roles and responsibilities ("I pay for this, you do this", "I ask you for this, you deliver this", etc.). Suppliers are used for commodities and from organizations you simply buy things from. (Another example is my Internet Service Provider. I buy my service from them, but they don't share with me their product development roadmap or integrate into my business, therefore they are a supplier.).    
  
  Your organization's strategy (partners, suppliers, also integrators of all) is based upon its goals, culture, and business environment.  
  
  
- **Is outsourced function considered to be a "Partner relationship" or more of "Suppliers relationship"?**  
  Supplier, not a partnership.  
  
  
- **What influences the supplier strategy, name a few topics we should care about when working on the supplier strategy getting ready?**  
  - Price  
  - Quality  
  - Reliability  
  - Track record  
  - Shareability  
  
  
- **What is a concept of Service integration?**  
  Service integration are a few things tighten together in order to deliver the service.  
  For example, video lectures delivering company may have: video service, store front, website, cloud hosting.  
  
  
- **Who deals with Service integration?**  
  - For example, where ony few partners and suppliers exists: Service integration and management might be kept **within** the organization.  
  - Another example, with lots of partners and suppliers: Service integration and management may also be delegated to a **service integrator**.  
    Now, with an integrator, the integrator is a partner to you, but they are coordinating all the individual suppliers on your behalf. I need to share my plans with the integrators (partnership), but I don't care about who the underlying suppliers are that they choose to use necessarily.  
    These integrators are kind of **a "strange" hybrid of a partner and a supplier**, but if I had to put them into one of those two categories, I would say they are more of a partner because they are deeply going to be embedded into your critical business functions.  
    For the exam, when they talk about partners and suppliers, though, they won't go into the service integrators (because they don't fit cleanly into one of the two categories). This was an area we needed to cover for the course, though, to make sure students understood the functions of these critical players in large IT projects that you will experience in the real world.  
  
  
- **What is Service Integration and Management about?**  
  (These are processes) involving the use of specially established integrators to ensure that service relationships are properly coordinated.  
  
  
- **Is it so that EVERY organization relies on other partners and suppliers?**  
  Yes. **Every** organization relies on other partners and suppliers.  
    

- **What Value Streams and Processes define?**  
  Define the activities, workflows, controls and procedures needed to achieve the agreed upon objectives.  
  More precisely this would be:  
  - The activities undertaken  
  - How activities are organized  
  - How value creation is ensured  
  
  
- **What is Value Stream?**  
  A series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to service consumers.    
  In every step we do there are value-adding activities and non value-adding activities (waste).  
  In business we want to increase value adding activities and to get rid of non value-adding activities.  
  
  
- **What Value Stream activities we want to automate?**  
  We want to optimize value stream so we can minimize the amount of non value-adding activities while increasing value adding activities. We want to automate this process as much as possible afterwards.  
  
  
- **What should be done first: optimization or automation?**  
  Optimize then automate.  
  
  
- **What is Process?**  
  A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs.  
  Processes are designed to achieve a specific objective.  
  A well-defined **process** can improve productivity, be optimized, and then become automated.  
  
  
- **What is the point of questioning: What is the generic delivery model for the service and how does the service work?**  
  This describes which processes do we put together so the value stream works.  
  
  
- **What questions are worth to be asked/considered when defining Value Stream?**  
  - What is the **generic delivery model** for the service and how does the service work?  
  - What are the value streams involved in delivering the agreed **outputs** of the service?  
  - **Who** or what will perform the required service **actions**?  
  
  
- **What is PESTLE model?**  
  Generic open-source model that stands for the acronym of PESTLE:  
  - P - Political  
  - E - Economic  
  - S - Social  
  - T - Technological  
  - L - Legal  
  - E - Environmental  
  These are 6 external factors that you cannot control. They gonna happen to you.  
  However, these are the external factors you have to take into account when designing your services and products.  
  PESTLE model describes factors that constrain or influence how a service provider can operate.  
  For example,  
  UBER: Social (people should get used to the new taxi service model),  
  Technological (willing to create a quantum-resistant encryption - quantum computers do not exist yet..),  
  etc.  
  
  
- **How many PESTLE factors may affect one of four different dimensions of service management?**  
  Every dimension is affected by multiple factors.  
  
  
- **Give an example applying four dimensions of service management?**  
  Let's take Incident management as an example.  
  - Organizations and People:  
    - Will service desk handle it?  
    - Or will there be Tier1, Tier2, Tier3 support?  
    - Or will it be a flat organization?  
    - How will we organize our communications? E.g. How Tier1 collected information will transfer to Tier2, and so on. How it all will be escalated to the next level?    
    - How many people do we need for a particular service incident management? What competences do they need? Any certified people on-board? e.g. if we use AWS we may need AWS certified people. What about people qualifications?  
    - How people will interact? Who/how we are going to motivate people?  
    - How do we gonna hire the new people?  
    - How do we keep the right people?  
    - How do we pay people?  
    - How will we make sure people are capable of doing incident management we want them to do?  
    - etc.  
  - Information and Technology  
    - How will I register the incident? Writing down on the paper? Registering into internet portal? Any special software and hardware involved?  
    - How between relationships between incidents? How do I know that one incident that happened today is related to the one that happened before? Any technology/software managing and tracking incident relationships? What about incidents and different items? What about incidents relationship to users affected?  
    - What about incident management tools for incident management flow? How will we do the workflow? How will we use knowledge bases?  
    - What about diagnostic tools?  
    - How will we detect and process events for incident management?  
    - How will we communicate with each other?  
    - How will we organize and share data?  
    - etc.  
  - Partners and Suppliers  
    - Maybe suppliers do not do a good job anymore because of some internal issues they experience and we need to consider a new contract?  
    - If we outsource services, how will we gonna escalate incidents to them once something is broken?  
    - Or maybe we manage minor issues and we escalate Tier2 or Tier3 issues to outsourced teams? How do we get information back when the issue is solved? Should other suppliers and partenrs be notified somehow?  
  - Value Streams and Processes  
    - Is the process optimized properly? Is there not too much waste in steps?  
  - PESTLE  
    - Maybe somebody hijacks the system because of values mismatch? For example, printer is always stuck because somebody things we should not print because we hurt environment.  
  
  
- **What is Service Value System (SVS)?**  
  Describes how all the components and activities of the organization work together as a system to enable value co-creation.  
  SVS may be configured and reconfigured in multiple combinations of organization resources.  
  SVS require **integration** and **coordination** of activities, practices, teams, authorities, and responsibilities.  
  
  
- **What is the purpose of Service Value System?**  
  The purpose is to ensure that the organization continually co-creates value with all stakeholders through the use and management of products and services.  
  
  
- **What are the three main basic blocks Service value system is made of?** 
  - Opportunity and demand (that's input)
  - Processes/activities (these are: Guiding principles, Governance, **Service value chain**, 34 Practices, Continual improvement)
  - Value (that's output)
  

- **What do Opportunities represent?**  
  Opportunities represent options or possibilities to add value for stakeholders or otherwise improve the organization.  
  E.g. find new markets, new customers, create new products, etc.  
  
  
- **What is Demand?**  
  Demand is the need or desire for products and services among internal and external consumers.  
  
  
- **What is the output of the Service Value System?**  
  Value is the outcome.  
  
  
- **What does System value system enable?**  
  Enables the creation of many different types of **value** for a wide group of stakeholders.  
  
  
- **Is ITIL 4 directive framework (you must follow) or best practices framework (you may follow)?**  
  ITIL 4 is best practices, not directive framework.    
  
  
- **What is Guiding Principle?**  
  !!! A recommendation that guides an organization in **ALL** circumstances.  
  !!! So this is also the reason why it all allows organizations to **integrate** them into an overall approach to service management.  
  !!! Guiding principles are applied **universally** to any initiative, all relationships with different stakeholder groups.  
  !!! Guiding principles support and encourage organizations in **continual improvement**.  
  !!! You should consider which of the guiding principles are **relevant** to your situation. Not all the principles are critical to every situation.  
  
  
- **What are 7 guiding principles in ITIL 4?**  
  - Focus on value (value for consumer, customer, service provider, etc.  )  
  - Start where you are  
  - Progress iteratively with feedback  
  - Collaborate and promote visibility  
  - Think and work holistically  
  - Keep it simple and practical  
  - Optimize and automate  
  
  
- **What does "Focus on value" guiding principle state?**  
  Everything the organization does should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders.  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Focus on value" (e.g. in four steps)?**  
  1. Understand and identify the service consumer  
  2. Understand the consumer's perspective of value  
  3. Map value to intended outcomes which **change** over time  
  4. Understand the customer experience or user experience  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Focus on value" (e.g. mention key factors when looking at application)?**  
  1. Know how your consumers and customers will use each service  
  2. Encourage a focus on value among the entire staff
  3. Focus on value during operational activity and during improvement activities
  4. Include a focus on value in every step of any improvement initiative
  
  
- **What does "Start where you are" guiding principle say?**   
  Don't start over without first considering what is already available to be leveraged.  
  Decisions on how to proceed should be based on **accurate** information.  
  Measurement should be used to **support** the analysis of what has been observed rather than to replace it.  
  Measuring can affect the results. E.g. Drive through restaurants may put you aside "wait in there we will come back to you in few minutes" in case you caused the delay (most likely ~30 seconds) for any reason and the staff is being measured by the time per order. The staff will then most likely mark your order as complete and come back to you when busy moment will pass by.  
  
  
- **What Goodhart's law states?**  
  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.  
  The original formulation by Charles Goodhart was: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes."  
  Therefore, measure your outcomes, not your outputs.  (because: people will start to hack any system on the way to just meet the targeted measure-based goal, almost no matter what)  
  
  
- **What should we measure: outputs or outcomes?**  
  Outcomes, not outputs.  
  (because: people will start to hack any system on the way to just meet the targeted measure-based goal, almost no matter what; learn more by browsing for Goodhart's law)  
  
  
- **How do we apply "Start where you are" (e.g. in four steps)?**  
  1. Look at what exists as objectively as possible  
  2. Determine if successful practices or services can be replicated or expanded  
  3. Apply your risk management in the decision making process  
  4. Recognize that sometimes nothing from your current state can be reused
