- **What are the industrial revolutions, when it has happened, what each of it has to do with ITIL?**  
  1st industrial revolution. Around 18-19 centuries. Humanity moved from agrarian-based farmer societies into urbanized industrial area. Mechanization (iron, textile), steam (e.g. steam engines) and water power. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  2nd industrial revolution. Around WWI (1st WWorld War) we moved to mass production and electricity. For example, steal, oil, electricity, electric-powered equipment, cars with internal combustion engines, light bulb light replace candle light, communication across long distance became possible through the use of a telephone, etc. Nothing to do with ITIL.  
  3rd industrial revolution (digital revolution). Around 1980s-1990s. Electronic and IT systems, automation. ITIL was starting in this period of time. ITIL ment Information Technology Infrastructure Library back then. (the name became not valid after ITILv4 release)  
  4th industrial revolution. Around early 21st century. It is happening now. Cyber physical systems in where we loose boundaries between physical and digital. For example: robotics, nano technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, autonomous cars,etc. ITIL4 is not an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, it is ITIL (just a brand name) for 4th industrial revolution. ITIL is for the entire service now.   
  
  
- **What is Service Organization?**    
  !!!THIS IS MY OWN ANSWER TAKEN FROM THE CONTEXT OF ITILv4 STUDY MATERIAL. THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. HOWEVER, I DO THINK IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR THE ITILv4 FOUNDATION CASE.!!!    
  It is an organization that is involved in services by any means.  
  Actually, Service management goes beyond services these days, we may probably call services "something".  
  
  
- **What is Service Management?**

  Organizational capability refers to having both the **capacity** and the **ability** to perform the functions required.  
  
  
- **What should organization do in order to perform the functions required?**    
  **Organize** people to best support the activities, practices, and processes. (None of these activities, practices, and processes could be done in isolation. Instead, organization should go through service management process.)

  The **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.   
  
  
- **Who determines the perceived value?**  
  The recipient determines the perceived value.   
  Value is based on **recipient's** perception.  
  The example of orange:   
  1st case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten, peel (0% value) is thrown away. Total value - 100%   
  2nd case: Orange got by one person, fruit's flesh (0% value) is thrown away, peel (100% value) is used for the cake. Total value - 100%  
  3rd case: Orange got by two people, fruit's flesh (100% value) is eaten by one person, peel (100% value) is used for the cake by another person. Total value - 200%    
  
  
- **Who creates the value?**   
  Value is **co-created** by the service provider and the consumer. Example certification course online - service provider should input the course, service consumer should take the course and successfully pass the exam after.  
  Value is **perceived** benefits, usefulness, and importance of **something**.  
  Value perceived is determined by the recipient.    
  
  
- **What is Organization?**    
  A person or a group of people that has its own functions, responsibilities, and relationships to achieve its objectives.  
  Organizations vary in size, complexity, and in their legal structure.  
  
  
- **What are two basic roles an ORGANIZATION can fulfill?**   
  1. Service Provider (supplier)  
  2. Consumer  
  Service Provider (supplier) AND Consumer may be simultaneous (e.g. providing services, having partners to manage, buying materials from somewhere, etc.).  
  
  
- **What are three basic roles PEOPLE can fulfill?**   
  User  
  Customer  
  Sponsor  
  All these basic roles people in organization may fulfill (user, customer, sponsor) may by fulfilled by the same person (e.g. buying a new car to myself) or several people (e.g. buying the new car for own child/user when mom/customer is picking the car and dad/sponsor is giving money for it).  
  
  
- **May a disconnect between requirements, budget, and usability occur?**  
  Yes. A disconnect between requirements (customer), budget (sponsor), and usability (user) may occur. This kind of disconnection may cause problems because sponsor who funds the requirements and customer who creates these requirements often have arguments over what those requirement should be.

  Organizations are bound together by common objectives, relationships, and authorities.  
  People are **organized** around common goals *within* a larger business organization to achieve common objectives in a coordinated method.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: User?**  
  A person who uses services.  
  User ~ usability.  
  
  
- **What is a role of: Customer?**  
  A person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.   
  Customer ~ requirements.

- **What is our responsibility as a Service provider in regards of three basic user roles within the company?**    
  It is our responsibility to recognize these three generic roles on a consumer side, and work with them appropriately.    
  
  
- **What is Service?**  
  **Means of enabling value co-creation** by **facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve**, **without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks**.  
  Services may be based on products.  
  
  
- **What is the whole reason Consumer (customer) hires Service provider?**    
  Costs and risks passed to Service provider refers to the whole reason why a consumer (a customer) hires a service provider in the first place.  
  
  
- **Can service provider achieve outcomes for a consumer?**  
  A service provider **cannot** achieve outcomes for a consumer. Consumer has to achieve outcomes by their self.  
  Service provider is only able to facilitate the achievement of those customer outcomes.

- **May services be based on products?**  
  Yes.  
  
  
- **What is Product?**  
  Configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for its customers.    
  Resources can be owned or managed by organization. Resources could be leased, or rented, could even be people working in organization, etc.    
  We may also think about it as a collection of services put together that provides more value together than they could individually.   
  A **product** is how an organization configures resources into an offer. For example, AWS has many service offerings but if you add these products into a set then it may become a product, e.g. Amazon lightsail.    
  A product **combines** and simplifies the various services.    
  
  
- **What is Service Offering**

  Service offering - "a description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources, and service actions."    
  *My answer to that:*
