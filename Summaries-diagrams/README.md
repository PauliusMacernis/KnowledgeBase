# Day #1: Docker

- Q: How do I deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes via CircleCI to AWS or other type of hosting platform?
- A: Docker basics first...

Take away:  
The scope was extreemly to big, try to minimize it. Late bed time is not ok for the health.  
Also, it is hard to keep going with the "drawing of the day" while the day contains several topics interconnected in the way it looks like you will have to continue with the part of the outcome of day#1 on day#2 drawing. Which basically means that I feel like closing the computer on day#1 at 10pm (instead of 3am) means topic is not solved completely enough and so I will have to either continue drawing on the day#1 diagram (which looks not acceptable to me - this proves the question of the day left open for tomorrow), either copy the good amount of day#1 drawing into day#2 content and continue building all further (which is also not acceptable to me - "do not repeat" is the good practice in my head, and the same content kind of says I do cary the same perspective of the question-problem of day#1 into day#2 which as a consiquence means the question of the day#1 is left open for tomorrow). I should close the perspective of day#1 on the end of the day#1. And if I want to continue with the topic of day#1 on day#2 then there should be some kind of another view-perspective into the same problem of yesterday, kind of "another view into the same question/issue/problem"? I wish to open the question on the morning and close it with the drawing at the end of the day.


# Day #2: docker-compose

- Q: How do I deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes via CircleCI to AWS or other type of hosting platform?
- A: docker-compose basics first.. including software life cycle: dev > test (> prod), theory on CI place in the cycle.

Take-away:
It seems I am not really solving the problem here.. It feels like I am on the course teaching basics which I known already in about 70-80%. However, it is a good course and it is worth to continue because the rest of 20-30% I don't know or already forgod is a very important part in a long-term view. However, again, I do not think the main question of the day is solved in the way I would be excited about it. There are lots of things on this topic to know and consolidated knowledge looks a bit better than just "a problem is solved" because a solved consolidated problem gives the solution for many cases in the future while "the problem is solved" may not, may be just a tip of the iceberg, lots of gaps, etc. Maybe not. Still a bit confusing. One side of me wants to get the entire topic so I will be able to be creative on this topic in the long-term, another part of me says solving the problem and so probably not really knowing the details underneath it is enough.


# Day #3: Docker > Travis CI > AWS

- Q: How do I deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes via Travis CI to AWS or other type of hosting platform?
- A: Deploying basic app first, including gitflow (features, pull requests) taken into account. Docker > Travis CI > AWS.

Take-away:
???

# Day #4: A simple but multi-container app example

- Q: How do I deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes via Travis CI to AWS or other type of hosting platform?
- A: Getting to there.. This is the example of more complex application - multi-container one, close to real-life experience.

Take away:  
Today was a busy day and I had a choice to make:  
1) Do a little move further with the same course on deployments topic or  
2) Do a huge diagram on another concepts touched through the day (which is not really a deployment topic).  
I took the 1st one, which is probably not the best thing for now because other concepts of today are left without drawings. 
However, I still do think that each morning should be started with the question and end with the diagram of the answer.
