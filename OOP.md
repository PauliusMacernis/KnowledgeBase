- **What is the difference between package (e.g. in Java) and namespace (e.g. in C#)?**  
Packages are used to organize files or public types to avoid type conflicts. Package cannot be nested. One source file can only have one package statement.  
Namespaces are used to organize programs, both as an "internal" organization system for a program, and as an "external" organization system.  
If you use VS and Eclipse and let them structure the project, then you will not feel the differences much.  
Okay, after the clarification: a Java package is similar to a C# namespace - except that it has an impact on accessibility, whereas in C# namespaces and accessibility are entirely orthogonal.
