Assembly language is as close to the processor as you can get as a programmer. Programs written in a high-level language are translated into assembly language in order for the processor to execute the program. The highlevel language is an abstraction between the language and the actual processor instructions. As such, the idea that “assembly is dead” is nonsense.  

The reasons for learning assembly language are more about understanding how a computer works instead of developing large programs.  

Since assembly language is machine specific, the lack of portability is very limiting for programming projects.
