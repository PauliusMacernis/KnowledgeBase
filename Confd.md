- **What is Confd?**  
Confd is a lightweight configuration management tool that allows you to keep configuration files up to date from data stored in backends like environment variables, Consul (https://www.consul.io/), Etcd (https://github.com/coreos/etcd), Redis (https://redis.io/), and others. You can also reload applications to pick up changes during runtime without restarting the container. With Confd, we can separate our configuration management from infrastructure code.
