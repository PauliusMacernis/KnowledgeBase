# Online Resources

- The Python Tutorial ( https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ ) - This section of the official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!
- The Python Language and Library References ( https://docs.python.org/3/index.html ) - The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly acquainted with Python you should use these resources more and more.
- Third-Party Library Documentation - Third-party libraries publish their documentation on their own websites, and often times at https://readthedocs.org/. You can judge the quality of a third-party library by the quality of its documentation. If the developers haven't found time to write good docs, they probably haven't found the time to polish their library either.
- The websites and blogs of prominent experts - The previous resources are primary sources, meaning that they are documentation from the same people who wrote the code being documented. Primary sources are the most reliable. Secondary sources are also extremely valuable. The difficulty with secondary sources is determining the credibility of the source. The websites of authors like Doug Hellmann ( https://doughellmann.com/blog/ ) and developers like Eli Bendersky ( http://eli.thegreenplace.net/ ) are excellent. The blog of an unknown author might be excellent, or it might be rubbish.
- StackOverflow ( http://stackoverflow.com/ ) - This question and answer site has a good amount of traffic, so it's likely that someone has asked (and someone has answered) a related question before! However, answers are provided by volunteers and vary in quality. Always understand solutions before putting them into your program. One line answers without any explanation are dubious. This is a good place to find out more about your question or discover alternative search terms.
- Bug Trackers - Sometimes you'll encounter a problem so rare, or so new, that no one has addressed it on StackOverflow. You might find a reference to your error in a bug report on GitHub for instance. These bug reports can be helpful, but you'll probably have to do some original engineering work to solve the problem.
- Random Web Forums - Sometimes your search yields references to forums that haven't been active since 2004, or some similarly ancient time. If these are the only resources that address your problem, you should rethink how you're approaching your solution.

# Python: Intro


All the bellow applies to Linux (have been using Ubuntu 22.04), it will most likely work with macos as well.  

# Anaconda

Anaconda is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. See https://anaconda.org/  
Anaconda is a program to manage (install, upgrade, or uninstall) packages and environments to use with Python.  
Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages. Over 160 scientific packages and their dependencies are also installed. If we install Anaconda, then a basic few packages are installed by default. However, you can install any more packages, if needed.  

If you are using Anaconda, you are in the `base(root)` environment by-default.  

Steps:

1. Download: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
2. Install: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/


## Anaconda Navigator

It is a graphical user interface that helps open up any installed applications, such as Jupyter notebook or VS code editor. See https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator  

`anaconda-navigator` - to Open Anaconda Navigator GUI.  


## Conda

Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, Fortran, and more.  
Along with managing packages, Conda is also a virtual environment manager. It's similar to virtualenv and pyenv, other popular environment managers.  
Installing conda will also install Python, if not already present.  
See https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

`conda --version` - find which version of Conda is in use.

`conda upgrade conda` and `conda upgrade --all` - update all the packages in the default environment

`conda update --all` - update all packages in an environment.

`conda env list` or `conda info --envs` - list all environments

`conda create -n tea_facts python=3` - to create Python 3 environment with Conda.  

`conda create -n env_name [python=X.X] [LIST_OF_PACKAGES]` - for example, `conda create -n my_env python=3.7 numpy Keras`  
 
`conda activate tea_facts` - to activate the environment for conda >=4.6.  
 `source activate tea_facts` - to activate the environment for conda <4.6.  
  
`conda list` or `conda list -n env_name` - list the packages installed. It's also possible to check if a specific package is installed, e.g. `conda list -n env_name scipy`

`conda env export` - see all the package-names, including the Python version present in the current environment. It's possible to output the result for sharing (e.g. git): `conda env export > environment.yaml` .To load the environment in, use `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
  
`conda install numpy pandas matplotlib` - install 3 libraries (numpy and pandas - to work with the data, matplotlib - for making visualizations). Conda also automatically installs dependencies. Note: Installing pandas by itself will also install numpy since numpy is a dependency of pandas.  

`conda install jupyter notebook` - install 2 more libraries to develop the code with

`conda install numpy=1.10` - specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number, if needed.

`conda remove PACKAGE_NAME` - remove a package.

`conda update package_name` - update a package.  

`conda search *SEARCH_TERM*` - search for a package to install, e.g. `conda search '*whateveryousearch*'` (note: shell may expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command, use single or double quotes to fix this).  

`conda install nb_conda` - installs Notebook Conda package to help manage environments in Jupyter Notebooks.

*Quite usefull:*  

- `conda create -n py3_env python=3` - create Python3 general environment, e.g. not tied to any specific project
- `conda create -n py2_env python=2` - create Python2 general environment, e.g. not tied to any specific project

Deactivate the environment:  

- `conda deactivate` - for conda >=4.6
- `source deactivate` - for conda <4.6

Remove the environment:  

`conda env remove -n env_name`  

**In case of git usage, e.g. sharing the code to public**:  

- `conda env export > environment.yaml` and then `conda env create -f environment.yaml`  


More commands: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html


# Miniconda

It's a smaller version of Anaconda. It includes Conda and Python, no preinstalled packages. Install new packages with `conda install PACKAGENAME`. Upgrade from Miniconda to Anaconda with `conda install anaconda`. See https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html  


# pip

The conda and pip both are the Python package managers.  
In the newer version of Anaconda/Miniconda, both pip and conda package managers are included by default.

pip comes preinstalled with the Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4.  

The available packages available from the Anaconda distribution in conda focus on data science, whereas pip is for general use.  

Pip can install both Python and non-Python packages. Pip can install any package listed on the Python Package Index (PyPI). See https://pypi.org/  

Pip has similar functionality with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` - export the list of packages in an environment to a file, to include that file with your code. This way it's possible to easily load all the dependencies for the code. You may then install it back with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html    

`pip --version` - check which pip version is installed.  

**In case of git usage, e.g. sharing the code to public**:  

- `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and then `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  

- pip vs. conda: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/  


# A Python environment

comprises a particular version of:  

- Python interpreter,
- Python-packages
- The utility scripts, e.g. pip


# Jupyter Notebooks

The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. **Notebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub.**, e.g. https://github.com/mcleonard/blog_posts/blob/master/body_fat_percentage.ipynb  

Notebooks are a form of literate programming proposed by Donald Knuth in 1984. See http://www.literateprogramming.com/  
**Just a small aside: recently, this idea of literate programming has been extended to a whole programming language, Eve.** See http://witheve.com/  

List of available kernels for Jupyter: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels  

`jupyter notebook` - run it. If the default port 8888 is taken then the server will run on the next free port (incremented by 1), e.g. http://localhost:8888/ , then http://localhost:8889/ , then http://localhost:8890/ , etc.  

`jupyter nbconvert --to FORMAT mynotebook.ipynb` - convert notebook file from JSON (native ipynb format) to something else, e.g.: HTML, LaTeX, PDF, WebPDF, Reveal.js HTML slideshow, Markdown, Ascii, reStructuredText, executable script, notebook.  For example, `pip install nbconvert` + `jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb`. p.s. If you wish to install any package in conda that is not available in Anaconda distribution, such as the Airbase package, use `pip install ...` instead of `conda install ...`. More info on nbconvert: https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html   

## Slideshow

.nbconvert may convert to slideshows too. Slides are full slides that you move through left to right. Sub-slides show up in the slideshow by pressing up or down. Fragments are hidden at first, then appear with a button press. You can skip cells in the slideshow with Skip and Notes leaves the cell as speaker notes. Test it: `jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve`

Don't forget to adjust each element of the notebook in order to have slides at all. In the menu bar, click View > Cell Toolbar > Slideshow to bring up the slide cell menu on each cell.


## Useful shortcuts:  

- `ctrl` + `enter`
- `shift` + `enter`
- `shift` + `tab`
- `shift` + `tab` (twice)
- `A` (while in a command mode) - create a cell above the current cell
- `B` - create a cell below the currently selected cell
- `Y` - change from Markdown to a code cell
- `M` - switch from code to Markdown
- `L` - turn on line numbers
- `D` + `D` (aka. click `D` twice) - delete the cell
- `S` - save the book
- `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `P` - bring the shortcuts menu (do not work on Firefix and Edge)
- `S` - see the shortcuts  

## Magic:  

- `%` (line magics) and `%%` (cell magics) - magic commands are preceded with one or two percent signs. For example, set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with %matplotlib. For example:
  - `%timeit` - how long it takes to execute the line
  - `%%timeit` - how long it takes to execute the entire cell
  - `%matplotlib inline` - to render figures (aka. visualizations) directly in the notebook, e.g. tweak config afterwards `%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'` 
  - `%pdb` - turn on the interactive debugger (Python kernel only), when you cause an error, you'll be able to inspect the variables in the current namespace. More info https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

# NumPy

NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations. At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, where nd stands for n-dimensional. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements **all of the same type**. **Remember, a NumPy array is homogeneous, meaning all elements will have the same data-type**. More info: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/ ,also http://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html  , and https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00564007/document, and the official user guide is here: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html  

NumPy handles more data types comparing to Python: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html  
ndarrays can hold strings as well. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html#arrays-dtypes  


# Python (and extra)

**Python is case sensitive.**

Note: **np.linspace - default step is 50 elements**  
Note: **np.linspace is about getting n amount of elements that fits within start and stop range where start is inclusive and stop may be inclusive/exclusive (depends on the flag passed)**  


Create a one-dimensional array with 16 elements where values are well ordered from 2 to 32 (both inclusive) and then make this one-dimensional array be 4x4 array (aka. matrix)

```
X = np.linspace(2, 32, 4*4).reshape(4,4)
print(X)

## Python error handling

- An Exception is a problem that occurs when the code is running, but a 'Syntax Error' is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs it. For more information, see the Python tutorial page on Errors and Exceptions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/how-george-boole-s-zeroes-and-ones-changed-the-world-1.2014673  


# Strings

You can define a string with either double quotes " or single quotes '  

```
>>> print(first_word * 5)

HelloHelloHelloHelloHello

>>> print(len(first_word))

5

>>> first_word[0]

H

>>> first_word[1]

e
```

`len` only works on a "sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set),", more info: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#len  

## Methods available:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

## Lists

```
>>> list_of_random_things = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]

>>> list_of_random_things[-1] 
True
>>> list_of_random_things[-2] 
a string
```

### The lower index of a slice is inclusive and the upper index is exclusive. And leaving out the lower index starts the slice at 0, while leaving out the upper index ends the slice at the end of the list.   


```
>>> list_of_random_things = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]
>>> list_of_random_things[1:2]
[3.4]
```

```
>>> list_of_random_things[:2]
[1, 3.4]
```

```
>>> list_of_random_things[1:]
[3.4, 'a string', True]
```

```
>>> 'this' in 'this is a string'
True
>>> 'in' in 'this is a string'
True
>>> 'isa' in 'this is a string'
False
>>> 5 not in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
True
>>> 5 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
False
```

```
>>> my_lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_lst[0] = 'one'
>>> print(my_lst)
['one', 2, 3, 4, 5]
# lists are mutable
```

```
>>> greeting = "Hello there"
>>> greeting[0] = 'M'
ERROR!!!
# strings are immutable
```

Lists are assigned "by reference", which means having two list variables made/assigned of the same list will result to both changing if any of the two change.

`len()` returns how many elements are in a list.  
`max()` returns the greatest element of the list. How the greatest element is determined depends on what type of objects are in the list. The maximum element in a list of numbers is the largest number. The maximum element in a list of strings is the element that would occur last if the list were sorted alphabetically. This works because the the max() function is defined in terms of the greater than comparison operator. The max() function is undefined for lists that contain elements from different, incomparable types.  
`min()` returns the smallest element in a list. min is the opposite of max, which returns the largest element in a list.  
`sorted()` returns **a copy of a list** in order from smallest to largest, leaving the list unchanged. Note again that for string objects, sorted smallest to largest means sorting in alphabetical order.  

### join

```
new_str = "\n".join(["fore", "aft", "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)
Output:

fore
aft
starboard
port
```

```
new_str = "\n".join(["fore", 1, "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)
Output:

ERROR, we can't join integer value
```

```
new_str = "\n".join(["fore", str(1), "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)
Output:

fore
1
starboard
port
```

### append

```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
letters.append('z')
print(letters)
Output:

['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z']
```

## Tuples

Immutable & Ordered

A tuple is an immutable, ordered data structure that can be indexed and sliced like a list. Tuples are defined by listing a sequence of elements separated by commas, optionally contained within parentheses: ().  

```
location = (13.4125, 103.866667)
print("Latitude:", location[0])
print("Longitude:", location[1])

dimensions = 52, 40, 100
length, width, height = dimensions
print("The dimensions are {} x {} x {}".format(length, width, height))

length, width, height = 52, 40, 100
print("The dimensions are {} x {} x {}".format(length, width, height))
```

```
tuple_a = 1, 2
tuple_b = (1, 2)

print(tuple_a == tuple_b)
print(tuple_a[1])

# True
# 2
```

## Sets

Mutable & Unordered  

A set is a mutable data structure - you can modify the elements in a set with methods like add and pop. A set is an unordered data structure, so you can't index and slice elements like a list; there is no sequence of positions to index with!  
  
One of the key properties of a set is that it only contains unique elements. So even if you create a new set with a list of elements that contains duplicates, Python will remove the duplicates when creating the set automatically.  


```
numbers = [1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 1, 6]
unique_nums = set(numbers)
print(unique_nums)
# {1, 2, 3, 6}
```


```
fruit = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grapefruit"}  # define a set

print("watermelon" in fruit)  # check for element

fruit.add("watermelon")  # add an element
print(fruit)

print(fruit.pop())  # remove a random element
print(fruit)

Output:
False
{'grapefruit', 'orange', 'watermelon', 'banana', 'apple'}
grapefruit
{'orange', 'watermelon', 'banana', 'apple'}
```

When you pop an element from a set a **random** element is removed (remember that sets, unlike lists, are unordered so **there is no "last element"**).

## Dictionaries

Mutable  

Stores mappings of unique keys to values.  

Dictionaries are mutable, but their **keys must be of immutable type**, like strings, integers, or tuples. Lists or alike would not work! Every key in a dictionary may have different type, e.g. `random_dict = {"abc": 1, 5: "hello"}`   

Each item in a dictionary contains two parts (a key and a value), the items in a dictionary are not ordered, dictionaries may be nested.  

Because dictionaries are not ordered, they are not sortable.  

```
elements = {"hydrogen": 1, "helium": 2, "carbon": 6}
print(elements["helium"]) # 2
elements["lithium"] = 3 
print(elements)
# {'hydrogen': 1, 'carbon': 6, 'helium': 2, 'lithium': 3}

print("carbon" in elements) # True

elements["whatever"] # ERROR!!!!!
print(elements.get("whatever"))  # None

n = elements.get("dilithium")
print(n is None) # True
print(n is not None) # False

```

```
>>> elements.get('dilithium')
None
>>> elements['dilithium']
KeyError: 'dilithium'
>>> elements.get('kryptonite', 'There\'s no such element!')
"There's no such element!"
```

List a and list b are equal and identical. List c is equal to a (and b for that matter) since they have the same contents. But a and c (and b for that matter, again) point to two different objects, i.e., they aren't identical objects. **That is the difference between checking for equality vs. identity**.

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)
print(a is b)
print(a == c)
print(a is c)

# True
# True
# True
# False
```

```
# create and sort a list of the dictionary's keys
sorted_keys = sorted(verse_dict.keys())
```


## Lists vs. Dictionaries

A set is defined with curly braces, {}, but it isn't the only data structure that does; dictionaries do as well! However, the difference is that a set is defined as a sequence of elements separated by commas:  
`set_example = {element1, element2, element3}`  
while a dictionary is defined as a sequence of key, value pairs marked with colons, separated by commas:  
`dict_example = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}`  

Note: if you define a variable with an empty set of curly braces like this: a = {}, Python will assign an empty dictionary to that variable. You can always use set() and dict() to define empty sets and dictionaries as well.  


## Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

```
Data Structure	Ordered	Mutable	Constructor	    Example
List	          Yes	    Yes	    [ ] or list()	  [5.7, 4, 'yes', 5.7]
Tuple	         Yes	    No	     ( ) or tuple()	 (5.7, 4, 'yes', 5.7)
Set	           No	     Yes	    {}* or set()	   {5.7, 4, 'yes'}
Dictionary	    No	     No**	   { } or dict()	  {'Jun': 75, 'Jul': 89}
```

* You can use curly braces to define a set like this: {1, 2, 3}. However, if you leave the curly braces empty like this: {} Python will instead create an empty **dictionary**. So to create an empty set, use set().  
** A dictionary itself is mutable, but each of its individual keys must be immutable.  

# If, Elif, Else

```
if season == 'spring':
    print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
    print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
    print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
    print('stay indoors!')
else:
    print('unrecognized season')
```

**Indentation - 4 spaces!!!**


Here are most of the built-in objects that are considered False in Python:  

- constants defined to be false: None and False
- zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)
- empty sequences and collections: '"", (), [], {}, set(), range(0)


# For

```
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']
for city in cities:
    print(city)
print("Done!")
```

```
# Creating a new list
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']
capitalized_cities = []

for city in cities:
    capitalized_cities.append(city.title())
```


```
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']

for index in range(len(cities)):
    cities[index] = cities[index].title()
```

```
for word in book_title:
    word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word, 0) + 1
```


`items` is an awesome method that returns tuples of key, value pairs, which you can use to iterate over dictionaries in for loops:  

```
cast = {
           "Jerry Seinfeld": "Jerry Seinfeld",
           "Julia Louis-Dreyfus": "Elaine Benes",
           "Jason Alexander": "George Costanza",
           "Michael Richards": "Cosmo Kramer"
       }
for key, value in cast.items():
    print("Actor: {}    Role: {}".format(key, value))
```

# Zip and Enumerate

zip returns an iterator that combines multiple iterables into one sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains the elements in that position from all the iterables. For example:

`list(zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]))` outputs `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`   


```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
nums = [1, 2, 3]

for letter, num in zip(letters, nums):
    print("{}: {}".format(letter, num))
```

```
some_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
letters, nums = zip(*some_list)
```

enumerate is a built in function that returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of a list.  

```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
for i, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print(i, letter)
```

```
cast = ["Barney Stinson", "Robin Scherbatsky", "Ted Mosby", "Lily Aldrin", "Marshall Eriksen"]
heights = [72, 68, 72, 66, 76]

# write your for loop here
for i, name in enumerate(cast):
    cast[i] = name + " " + str(heights[i])

print(cast)

# Prints:
# ['Barney Stinson 72', 'Robin Scherbatsky 68', 'Ted Mosby 72', 'Lily Aldrin 66', 'Marshall Eriksen 76']
```

## ??? What are the differences and similarities between the usage of `range` and `enumerate` when the wish is to iterate over the data ???


## ??? explain each line (these are not related): ???

```
for point in zip(labels, x_coord, y_coord, z_coord):

points.append("{}: {}, {}, {}".format(*point))

cast = dict(zip(cast_names, cast_heights))

names, heights = zip(*cast)

data_transpose = tuple(zip(*data))
```

# List Comprehensions


List comprehensions allow us to create a list using a for loop in one step.  

```
capitalized_cities = [city.title() for city in cities]

```

```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(9) if x % 2 == 0]
```

```
squares = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x + 3 for x in range(9)]
```

```
names = ["Rick Sanchez", "Morty Smith", "Summer Smith", "Jerry Smith", "Beth Smith"]

first_names = [name.lower().split(' ')[0] for name in names] # write your list comprehension here
print(first_names)

# ['rick', 'morty', 'summer', 'jerry', 'beth']
```

```
multiples_3 = [ item * 3 for item in range(1,21,1)  ] # write your list comprehension here
print(multiples_3)
# [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60]
```

```
scores = {
             "Rick Sanchez": 70,
             "Morty Smith": 35,
             "Summer Smith": 82,
             "Jerry Smith": 23,
             "Beth Smith": 98
          }

passed = [ name for name, score in scores.items() if score >= 65 ] # write your list comprehension here
print(passed)
```

```
win_count_dict = {}
for year, winnerlist in winners.items():
    for winner in winnerlist:
        win_count_dict[winner] = win_count_dict.get(winner, 0) + 1
```


```
highest_count = max(win_count_dict.values())

most_win_director = [key for key, value in win_count_dict.items() if value == highest_count]
```

# Functions

If there is no return statement, the function simply returns None.  

It is possible to pass values in two ways - by position and by name.   

```
cylinder_volume(10, 7)  # pass in arguments by position
cylinder_volume(height=10, radius=7)  # pass in arguments by name
```

```
def readable_timedelta(days):
    # use integer division to get the number of weeks
    weeks = days // 7
    # use % to get the number of days that remain
    remainder = days % 7
    return "{} week(s) and {} day(s).".format(weeks, remainder)

# test your function
print(readable_timedelta(10))
```

Scopes seems to be just local (e.g. defined inside functions stays inside functions) or global (defined in a global level are reached inside functions too). The global part seems to be a bit different comparing to PHP (the latest PHP versions would not receive the value of the global just like that..). However, JavaScrip seems to be quite similar.

Python: However, the value of a global variable can not be modified inside the function. If you want to modify that variable's value inside this function, it should be passed in as an argument. Good practice: It is best to define variables in the smallest scope they will be needed in. While functions can refer to variables defined in a larger scope, this is very rarely a good idea since you may not know what variables you have defined if your program has a lot of variables.  

```
# This works fine
word = "hello"

def some_function():
    print(word)

some_function()
```

```
<?php

$hello = "hello";

function testing() {
	echo $hello;	        # NOTICE Undefined variable: hello on line number 6
}

testing();
```

```
// JavaScript

let hello = "hello world";
function helloWorld() {
    console.log(hello);
}
helloWorld();
// prints: hello world
```

**Python doesn't allow functions to modify variables that aren't in the function's scope.**  

```
egg_count = 0

def buy_eggs(egg_count):
    egg_count += 100
    return egg_count + 12  # purchase a dozen eggs

buy_eggs(egg_count)

print(egg_count) # prints 0
```

```
egg_count = 0

def buy_eggs(count):
    count += 100
    print(egg_count)
    return count + 12  # purchase a dozen eggs

egg_count = buy_eggs(egg_count)

print(egg_count)

# Prints:
# 0
# 112
```

```
str1 = 'Functions are important programming concepts.'

def print_fn():
    str1 = 'Variable scope is an important concept.'
    print(str1)

print_fn()

# Output:
# Variable scope is an important concept.
```

```
str1 = 'Functions are important programming concepts.'

def print_fn():
    #str1 = 'Variable scope is an important concept.'
    print(str1)

print_fn()
# Output:

```

**This may summarize the scope of Python variables quite well**  

```
str1 = 'One'

def print_fn(str1):
    print(str1)
    str1 = 'Two'
    print(str1)

print_fn(str1)
print(str1)

Prints:
One

## Public / Private / Get / Set (no protected, private!!!, just some "conventions"...)

Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages, but **not in Python**. Instead, the general object-oriented programming convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values. These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods.  
In the class definition, the underscore in front of price is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be *explicitly labeled as a private variable*. This would prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly like shirt_one._price = 15. **Unlike other languages, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables**. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python.  

Following the Python **convention, the underscore in front of property is to let a programmer know that the property should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing it directly with my_object._my_property**. However, a programmer could still access _price directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent direct access.

class Shirt:

    def __init__(self, shirt_color, shirt_size, shirt_style, shirt_price):
        self._price = shirt_price

    def get_price(self):
      return self._price

    def set_price(self, new_price):
      self._price = new_price


shirt_one = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 15)
print(shirt_one.get_price())
shirt_one.set_price(10)


class Pants:
    
    def __init__(self, color, waist_size, length, price):
        self.color = str(color)
        self.waist_size = int(waist_size)
        self.length = int(length)
        self.price = float(price)
        
    def change_price(self, price):
        self.price = float(price)
        
    def discount(self, discount):
        return self.price * (1 - discount)

# Some statistics...

When finding the probabilities using a continuous distribution, the probability of obtaining an exact value is zero. If the question had been what is the probability that a man's weight is between 184.99 and 185.01, then the answer would be a small but positive value of 0.0002.  

The area under the Gaussian curve represents the probability.
