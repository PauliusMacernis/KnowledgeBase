  - **What is Clojars ( https://clojars.org/ ) for?**  
  It is community repository for open source Clojure libraries.
  
  - **What is Leiningen ( https://leiningen.org/ )?**  
   Leiningen is the Clojure counterpart of Maven, a popular Java build tool. It uses a Maven-compatible dependency management system, and therefore it has access to large and well-maintained repositories of Java libraries. In addition, Clojure libraries are commonly found in the Clojars repository. This repository is enabled by default in Leiningen.
   
  - **What is Luminus ( http://www.luminusweb.net/ )?**  
  Luminus is a Clojure micro-framework based on a set of lightweight libraries.
  
  - **What is H2 (DBMS) ( http://www.h2database.com/ )?**  
  H2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode.
  
  - **How to run the new Luminus +H2 project on Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)?**  
1. Place the following code into: `/home/__USER__/.lein/profiles.clj` to follow the same lein-template version:
```{:user
 {:plugins [[luminus/lein-template "2.9.10.74"]]}}
```
2. Run `lein new luminus guestbook +h2` to create a new application by specifying luminus as the template name and guestbook as the project name, and add the +h2 parameter to indicate that we want to have an instance of the H2 embedded database initialized for us.  
3. Run `lein run -p 8000` to start the application on port 8000. When you run the application, it may take a little while because Leiningen first has to retrieve all of its dependencies. Once downloaded, the dependencies are cached locally in the `~/.m2/repository` folder and will be available on subsequent runs.
4. Open a web browser and check for `http://localhost:8000/`

  - **How to create migration files (_datetime_-guestbook.up.sql & _datetime_-guestbook.down.sql) by using `lein`?**  
  `lein migratus create guestbook`
  
  - **How to run migrations by using `lein`?**  
  `lein run migrate`
  
  - **What are SQL template files used by the HugSQL library (files generated by default when creating luminus project)?**  
  A new luminus project contains a file called `resources/sql/queries.sql`. This file is already populated with some sample query templates. The function names are specified using the `-- :name` comment followed by hints indicating the type of query, and the parameters are prefixed with the `:`. The `-- :doc` comment is used to generate the documentation metadata for the function. Otherwise, the queries are written using regular SQL syntax.  
```
-- :name get-user :? :1
-- :doc retrieve a user given the id.
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = :id
```
  - **What kind of flags exists within SQL templates by the HugSQL?**  
  `:!` - the query is destructive (update, delete, insert)  
  `:n` - the query returns the number of affected rows (update, delete, insert)  
  `:?` - the query does a select  
  `:*` - the query returns multiple rows  
  `:1` - the query returns one row (@TODO: check if this is true)  
  
  - **How does the file `resources/sql/queries.sql` get read (files generated by default when creating luminus project with H2)?**  
  - The `projectname.db.core` namespace contains a call to the `conman.core/bind-connection` macro. This macro reads the SQL queries that we defined in `resources/sql/queries.sql` and creates Clojure functions that call them using the name specified using the `-- :name` comment.
