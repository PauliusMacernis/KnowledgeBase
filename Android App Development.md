- Are upper-case letters allowed in resource names within Andriod Studio?
<a href="#" title="
Upper-case letters are not allowed due to case-sensitivity issues between different operating systems. For example: file names within Windows are case-sensitive while filenames within Linux are not. Just do not use upper-case letters in resource names. Use caracters 0 to 9 and lowercase a to z, as well as underscore and period (sometimes also called 'full stop'). Tested on Android Studio 2.3.1.
