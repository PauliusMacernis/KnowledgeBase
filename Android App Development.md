## Android App Development

- **What is Android Studio?**  
IDE for Android applications to develop.

- **What are Android Studio Templates for? For example: `Basic Activity`, `Empty Activity`, `Fullscreen Activity` templates.**  
These are just sets of pre-made configurations for the easier start when building the new app.

- **What is an activity?**  
???

- **What is the difference between an activity and a content xml files inside a layout directory?**  
Both describe the layout. The content file is actually part of the activity file (the activity file includes the content file).

- **What is Gradle?**  
Gradle is an open-source build automation system. Gradle pulls together all bits of the project to create the application file that can be installed on an Android device.

- **Are upper-case letters allowed in resource names within Andriod Studio?**  
Upper-case letters are not allowed due to case-sensitivity issues between different operating systems. For example: file names within Windows are case-sensitive while filenames within Linux are not. Just do not use upper-case letters in resource names. Use caracters 0 to 9 and lowercase a to z, as well as underscore and period (sometimes also called 'full stop'). Tested on Android Studio 2.3.1.
